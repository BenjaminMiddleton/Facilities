  summary: "The team explored how AI could free engineers and administrators from repetitive tasks, from pulling key requirements out of lengthy RFQs and standardising quotation formats, through automating contract-compliance checks, purchase-order creation and invoice matching, to enabling richer post-delivery data capture for future product innovation. By building focused “apps” – for RFQ parsing, PO processing and spend-analytics – each department could reclaim hours each week to collaborate on higher-value activities and more creative problem-solving. Next steps include defining and prioritising the most pressing pain points, confirming the scope and desired outcomes with senior stakeholders, and then working with subject-matter experts (such as the lead gear designer) to capture existing costing rules. From there, bespoke AI-powered prototypes can be drafted – complete with data integration plans for material prices and lead times – to demonstrate measurable time and cost savings before rolling out more ambitious, cross-departmental solutions.",

  transcription: `My presentation for my role. I came back in yet. I've been interviewing present what you want to do for the first 90 days. So I did like an interrogation of all the kind of businesses that we compete against and one of the things that was missing from most of the businesses in our Engineering Services is, um, is innovation.  So, my big thing was to come back here to envisage and be head of innovation. I then picked up engineering at the same time, says Innovation engineering. But I, I love Innovation. So I started looking at how before I joined, how can you be Innovative? So, Um, you have to be to be Innovative, you have to have time.  And at the moment, everyone is so stressed with all the kind of menial tasks that they can't actually be Innovative. Because um, they're TB to doing all the boring stuff that takes too long. So uh, my my plan was to come back in and try and find ways to reduce the time.  It takes people to do their job, to give them more time to be interviewed. There's no point in me trying to help people be Innovative and trained to be Innovative if they don't have the time. So, um, we started talking about how we could do that in the business and then we our computer person who supplies our Computer Services.  Knows Ben and Alistair and they're a small company. They've set up after leaving University to um, to use AI. So we had an initial conversation about how can we use AI inside the business to reduce the workflow to increase the productivity of the people working there? Because literally, we do 70 quotations, we get so many rfqs that, you know, it takes so long to reply and you don't reply to them in a standard format either.  So different departments Supply in different ways. So the quaffs are always different depending on who's done it. The costs are there for more or less accurate depending on who's done it and you never get a standard across the board. So we decided to start some investigation into AI and others meeting with Ben Asda.  We've got to join together as a team to create Some kind of app system that will help increase people's productivity with the goal being that. Therefore, instead of taking seven hours to do one task, it might take them only an hour and therefore they get six hours back and the idea is not to take the six hours back.  The idea was then to give them 6 hours free time that we can then talk about Innovation and how they can be Innovative in the way they operate and the way they work. And so in the background that we're doing a screens here, every month we're changing the screensaver on our laptops with different terms about about being Innovative.  So our three keywords I'll keep forget what they are. Um, learning Innovation and transformation. That's our three key words and then we're putting some some comments next to it and changing the the screensaver every month in the background, we're trying to set up an innovation technology, Innovation Suite in in the building where we're going to create a environment where it's safe to be Innovative.  Because one of the problems that people have is they're nervous or frightened about saying stuff, in case they get people taking to make care of them. But then sometimes, um, they're the ones that spark ideas off. That might not be the right direction, but it can spark something off the other way.  So, we're now we started our first project with, with Ben Aster. We've done a minute taker and we've got that to a point. Now, that we'll listen to what the recording and then it will then summarise the recording completely transcribing. And then it will then put down them who, what points or what?  Um, actions people have got from it. The next step on is to make it more Progressive and do more stuff with it, but essentially that's where we're at. But what we're looking at is ways we can save time using AI. So examp I keep using. I had a quotation for a company.  114 pages on it. It was for it was for an aircraft seat, aircraft seat table, and it is impossible to learn all of that data to pull out what the key deliverables are, what the timing is what stuff. So our quotations got a standard format in it, even though people have definitely got standard columns and headings in it, you can type that heading in and it gave me the answers.  So what would have taken me? I don't know if I'm gonna take me three weeks to do. I did it in like five hours. Yeah, I asked AI, what are the key points of this of this RFQ watch staircase, what's the date? There it goes. And all you have to do is read through it and if you're, and this is where you've got to be smart.  If you're not very intelligent, you can't really read through it, understand it. But if you read through it, you can see, uh, whether it's relevant or not and and then you can take some of the stuff out where it repeats, or you can ask it to redefine it. So we've been using AI to fill out our quotation.  So we've done one. Like I said, which is 116 pages. It comes to like 650k in the end. So it's quite a big project. Yeah. That way you're able to do that. Nation really, really quickly by using AI. So a few what we want to try and do now is we're going to look at different apps.  We can create for our business. So one of them is the minute taker because minutes are really difficult what we try and struggle with and is structure because Um, you write in the minutes and you're trying to control the meeting at the same time, which is almost impossible to do really hard to do, right?  So the idea is the person sharing them, he just sits there and controls the meeting and sets tasks for people and can control it better without worrying about trying to write the minutes at the same time because if you're trying to do, but if it's really hard to do and then some of the meetings are too sensitive that you can't have like A person come in and take their loans for you sort of thing.  So, The idea is we're creating this app that you can use then for a minute, taking we want to do one, then that does That does the quotation thing. That reads, the RFQ creates a quotation. Fills it all out in a standard format. So we always have the same content going back to customers.  Um, and then it kind of standardises it across the range, but the other point of the meeting minute thing though, is that we don't do what we say, we're going to do, Because there's no minutes but it's not structured. Whether so I go back to the key thing about that meeting videos is that we want to try and make it so that people now know, when they come next week to the meeting, they will be on there.  Exactly what today we're going to do because it's been recorded and transcribed back again, there's no getting out of this and the idea is to try and then change people's mindsets that you go to the meeting prepared, with the answers, not just going to the meeting. Thinking if I can just like it, I can block this for a two-week cycle which is, I've got asked for week one.  Both of it done a week two or I don't know about it week two. It only goes to week. Three is suddenly two weeks have gone by before. We've actually sold the problem, you're supposed to be doing, but you want to be doing that once a week and having good answers and replies.  So, that's the point of the minute taker the quotation up. And then we're also looking at like an internal chatbot. So we have loads of quotation data like stores of it. And what one of the customers we spoke to suggested was that they have also have loads and loads of files for internal use that.  Um, they get a project coming from a customer. I think we just want that like three years ago but they can never find the one you want. And I know, you know, you can search I was trying to find it but with a chatbot you might even be able to get it to not only find it, but also  So that's we are trying to increase productivity. Of um, our team to make them. So you have more time to be Innovative. We started talking to some customers, just off the Record about what they would look at doing and then uh, William put us in charge with Andrew and then so we've come this way around.  So we're just like talking to customers about what What would they use it for and what are their their pain points at the moment that we can help increase their productivity? What you do with the productivity is up to you? Yeah I mean we're perhapsody doing it to give us more time to be Innovative but there might also be some Costco and measures where you find that.  Some people are doing duplication or if the work becomes easy you don't need so much power or you can re-deploy that Manpower somewhere else more effectively. Yeah. See my first thought from your side is the amount of data analysis that Alice does, you know, is there something there that you could?  Well, yeah, we've been working really on that. We we done drills. Yeah, we've we've done a step further by by automating that data, that is this. So that's something that we've got We've we've um we've done but um I mean what you're saying is like music to my age because that's that's really what we want to do.  Yeah um A few notes I've taken about about the way I see it for for my activities and how it could benefit you and is around. So you you mentioned productivity but it's also about efficiency. Yes. Yeah, absolutely, yeah. So really for us becoming more efficient. We are a small company.  We work together. Yeah. But still we don't necessarily have that full solidarization, yeah, that you mentioned. I think we need we need that and if AI could help us without be great but also the participation of people. Yeah. And so to give you some example. So for sustainability, for example I had introduced a form uh through a tool that we use at school smartsheet and on a monthly basis.  I was saying that four minute reminder, to people to fill in some ideas about how we could reduce you to initial the facility. And, I don't think it was efficient, you don't on their side, or on my side to manage, uh, the reminder to manage the response. Yeah. Right.  You know, all that things that is beyond people responding to a phone. Yeah. Is also about what you do with the information. Yeah. Uh, how do you organise it? How do you organise the actions that you can take from it? What do you do? The follow-up on the actions?  Yeah, because that's another thing is the photo work. Yeah, you discuss about for example Innovation, you come up with ideas but then it's about making them become real. Yeah. And so that they don't just say IDs but then you have like a real follower. Yeah. Um, what you want to do, um, you know, it's almost like creating like a personal assistant for people.  Yeah. Because that's what we need. Ultimately, is all of us in our day-to-day job, it's like all the stuff that we do. That takes us like so much time. And in order stuff that we are frustrated about that is the interesting bit that we can't do because we never have exactly we are always quarter up in the day-to-day stuff and And I think we talked about it.  We don't rule last week, but we, we all talked about, like, both like talked about the same thing without talking to each other. So it's like, yeah, we need a personal assistance. That's what we need in our life is like a virtual personal assistant, all that rubbish thing, one of the customers said the same thing.  So the minute taking may help but what it doesn't do, well what he needs to do is to set up the next meeting. So if in the meeting you said, right, I'll set another meeting up tomorrow. We'll talk about that again. Yeah, they don't have time to set the media, the guy because I've been meetings all day.  I get to the end of five minutes. There it goes. Oh special tomorrow. So so that has already been mentioned by another customer where it sets up the follow-up uh, meetings for you or is like almost like a personal assistant and it's all about what you were saying is that, if you get rid of all that, then you have time to actually prepare For the next question.  Yeah, black. And then you have that proper action, follow-up, and, and makes things materialise and then save time about how long it takes to it takes you to actually Implement something and I'll tell you what else, as well. It's quite interesting, so you get more time, but the other day we had a customer.  Ask us really crazy question, right? He wanted a design studio in the UK, so we could do the designer firming up, for certainly, we've got designers, there you go. And we sent a question before Christmas and it wasn't very quiet. Then just recently come back and said, actually, I want it in London.  Why'd you want it London for? Oh, because it's got the vibe in them right now. I was going. Oh, how am I gonna find out, like, where to place it in London? They don't know where they want it. They just won it in London, right? Then there's a big place.  Where'd you want it? So, I went home and I thought I'm gonna do. So I asked AI what car companies have design studios in London and it told me five different options. Of where different companies are doing it. So I was able to go back to say, hey guys, look, I've looked online.  I found these two companies. We're going to position you in a similar place to them. One was mg and what was Nissan, right? So we're going to position you in that place. It's like, so that could have taken me hours to find out if I would have taken me days to find information on it, where's who's based in London where an AI did it in 20 minutes?  And I was sitting there going, I feel a bit cheated because I've actually done a job that should have taken me normally getting seven hours. I've done it in 20 minutes, and it's really quite surreal that sending you all this time back. And you're like, I feel really, it feels really weird.  That you've done something really, really quickly would have taken a long time. More me to do, it's really weird managing your expectations, how long things. Like once you get that feel then I can do this in 20 minutes rather than seven hours. And the same thing with that that massive long quote.  Wow it's unlimited. I think what else? We're so our ultimate thing is to have their meeting like we're sitting here now. So have a technical problem or some problem. We need to talk about AI is listening to us. It's recording, it's listing and understanding what we're talking about. America pop starts popping up, answers on Suggestions.  So we're talking about maybe there's a gear as to whatever it is, failing, is fatigue life or something. It's listened to what you're saying. It's going online. It's sifting through the whole world finding out other examples of maybe put suggestions up now, they may be rubbish suggestions. So we've got a trainer to make it better, but the idea is it will give you ideas.  That might spark other things off instead and it's just what I'm listening. I'm really into this. So I'm listening to this AI book and there's a game so they taught AI back in 2012 to play the space emitters game and basically you fire a paddle goes across and you've got to knock out the blocks before they get to you.  Right? So it does it and the winning work, the winning way to play the game. Is you set it and keep knocking out a whole column. Then you farther Puck up the column, hits the back one, and just knocks all the blocks out from the rear. So it took AI about either three days to learn that, which is quite impressive, and then it learnt to play chess and there's a game in Asia called go.  That Scott like, it's a trillion times most More complex than chess and they played it against the Grandmaster. They won the first game and on the second game it played a move that a human wouldn't do because it will lose. If you play that move he played that game at move and it won still.  So what is there? We're using 20 for 20 of our brain, right? Where's the other 80 going and AI might find that other 80 of ideas, you don't even know about. So it's played that game. But your humans will never do that because it will always lose, but it won.  I think the, uh, human playing. That AI said it was a beautiful move. They found it like, like moving, like what are we all those answers are out there we make, we we haven't thought about because we're only using a small percentage about brain power that AI can help us with.  So that's where That's where we're trying to go increase productivity but also maybe you can come up with ideas that we would never think of because we're at least 20 of our brain. Imagine you say like hey Hubert uh what did you mean by that? You know, whatever you want to call your your chat bot or whatever that I think it was like, like any new things that that is coming up.  Um, we need also to be um, likewise about how we use it, because you could end up permanently like using AI for absolutely anything. Yes. Yes. And then and then it would be counterproductive. Uh, so we need to choose our batteries. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we need to do it.  Where is it essential for us to And they kind of lose control because we go so far into the future. But like you say, we are being, uh, held back pulled back down by the HR director because we do get a little bit career. Yeah, you kind of you've got to um use it sensibly and you've got to use it in the right place to increase that productivity but there's a lot of low-hanging fruits so we're talking to different companies.  They're all saying similar kind of thing about productivity and helping, you know, that churn stuff that takes so long to do. It doesn't really add much value. Yeah. But I think for us is and for anybody it's also about using that as a tool to um, Also think out of the box in terms of that how we approach our work, our work.  Yeah. And maybe approaching it from a different angle. Yeah. And because that's why we regain from it. Yeah, absolutely. Um, You know, helping also changing the mindset and typically a company like, us has been created. Back in 1957, we designed gearbox our product, our design have been designed the same way.  Yeah, yeah. Four years and years and years, right? So like how could AI help us, you know, in, in that way because we want to also include sustainability, yeah, into the design of our product. And that's why I want to focus on as well. Is like, on one side is the efficiency opportunity quick wins.  Yeah. But then on the other is how can you use AI on our product and on our operation? Yeah, yeah. The, the product is okay, we've been designing. It's almost like if you could feed Um, You know, the database of all our design into an AI. Yeah. And then, what would the AI come up with, in terms of?  How would you design gearbox like this home? You design them differently? Yeah. Uh, could you design them? Um, with less complexity? Uh, could you use different materials? Could use less material? So they are, they are, um, exactly. So yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Less weight into the into the process.  You use less energy. The, the weight of the gearbox itself is much lower. Yeah, you know, this kind of thing. Yeah. But obviously it's complicated but it's really about the, the basic for me is, is how can this tool help us be more efficient, more productive on our product operation, but as well help us to think out of the box and then change the mindset of the, of the entire company.  Yeah. Yeah. Um yeah so just because it's like, Uh the problem we've got is, is when we start thinking it's like, oh, you can apply AI at every single part of the company, you know, and it's every stage, so it's the productivity level, but then it's the Innovative level as well.  Where do you start? You know, is our approach, is tend to be that low-hanging. It's the easy stuff. Let's just make room for you to start thinking and whatever. By getting rid of the boring tasks, but very quickly, you start thinking about actually. Yeah, we can use this to.  We can try in a chatbot just purely on your old data. Like you said about everything you've designed and it can start looking at, you know, coming up with new ideas or whatever, you know. Um this. Yeah, there's so many so many potential but our approach really in terms of the software that we're starting to think about is to is rather than having one single be-all end-all thing that gets confusing and he's trying to do everything.  Is to isolate them. So you've got the minute taker, um, and then you would have like, a quote generator and whatever, so that people actually use the thing. You know, they know exactly what that's going to do. That one piece of software and it's, it's quite Limited in in its scope, but it's very capable of that single thing.  The problem with AR, you know, if you've gone to chat CBT or whatever, it's it's trained on the whole world and you don't know where it's pulling the data from it, it might be getting it from forums, that's got the wrong information. Yeah, um, whereas, if you've got your own data that's, you know, and a lot of it, it's really, really good because you can just say, right?  We only want you to be learning from this. Um, and then, you know, it's high quality information. Then I think with the the minute taker, the way we're doing it, it kind of is really a personal assistant in a way because if you imagine you have a meeting, um, it then assigns action points to different people.  Everyone can see the action points that different people have got, and by the time you get around the next meeting, you're thinking well that person hasn't hasn't Got that one done yet because you'll be able to see when it's done or it's not done. You might be able to get it done for them or whatever.  Um and I think that incentive as well to know that everybody's kind of aware of what everybody else should be doing. Um yeah it makes everyone more productive as well. Yeah. Um, So yeah, so because there's so many ideas that we can come that we can come up with My point of view for what we should be doing to start with is obviously these quick wins for, um, starting with this idea of the personal assistant to facilitate our day-to-day job and understand whatization without yeah, standardising.  It's good. Yeah, about how we work together, you know, the, the, um, the tools that we used to work together and be sure that we have that as a black uniformity and and standard that would be If we could start with that, I think that would be amazing. Yeah.  And then we can get to the more like long-term continuity and stuff. That means a bit more brainstorming. Yeah, yeah. I think, yeah, I think one of the problems that companies are finding is that if it you don't have your own AI software and strategy, people are going to use it anyway.  They are all going to be using chat gbt and you could you can tell your staff don't use it because you you know you can if you upload a quote or something like that. That's got confidential information in there. There's no way of knowing if someone has or hasn't done that you know.  So your staff member could do it and and get, I mean this the benefit to them of getting AI to, to write something for them is so massive, it's a tiny risk. If someone's going to catch them doing it, whereas if you've got your own, um, secure AI, uh, then that you can give them and say, do it with this one.  Then obviously, you know, there's no risk thing to do that instead and that's kind of the the approach we're trying to come up with is all right. AI stuff is all local. Really posted. So you would have it if you have your own servers or whatever. We installed the models there.  Nothing would leave your facility. It could run offline. Yeah, so one of the problems is that if you talk to chatting or Microsoft's one, um, the co-pilot whatever You are training that model. Yeah um and even if you even if you they say it's not You don't really know there's already been scandals with Microsoft so so our approach has been to kind of download the latest models and train our own versions and then store them locally.  So Um and there might be an idea of if companies haven't got the investment to be able to have their own gpus or top quality servers, um, The envisage might be able to to yeah to hosting instead and you have some sort of agreement there with security or whatever.  So I attended a conference uh, back in March and there were a lot. So it was organised by the economists and there was a lot of conversation around AI but not AI as a tool to use to, um, you know, to do things that we are talking about right now, but more about Ai and the use of energy and the need for energy actually, right?  Yeah. Um, yeah. Because it's really, really, um, like a hungry with with energy. Is it something that you you looking at when you, you say like you've got your own to be like we can. So how does that what they're talking about is training? Large language models. Um which requires a ridiculous massive massive gpus.  We don't need to do that because They've been trained, they're already very good and we can download those models and adapt them. So we're not you know, we're not going to be doing something that Google's doing. I mean this was I don't know if you saw in the news the the Chinese Scandal.  So it wasn't really Scandal but um, there's a company called deepsea. Yeah. Yeah. He's a Chinese company and what they did, they managed to train their own large language model by having conversations with chatgbt To basically ask it, um, questions about itself now openai who who runs chat gpt, they tried to protect it so that that information doesn't come out but if you're quite clever, you know, you can go back and forth.  And get it to reveal, its own algorithms and whatever else. And they used that to actually train their own large language model for a much much smaller. Um energy cost Um so that's that's the route it's going down. It's gonna I mean then there's A lot of investment in, like, in America that talking about these large data factories, aren't they?  And I think with GPT is that every time you prompt it with anything, it's as if like you know when If I was to ask you a question about houses, your brain can go down neural Pathways that are very efficient so you don't have to use all of your energy and you you're tired within an hour of thinking Church EPT.  Every time you prompt it, it's asking everything. It's asking its whole knowledge base using 100 of the brain. Not the 20 every time, this new way of doing things, the reasoning way with something like deep seek that they've discovered couldn't think like a human brain and just do the efficient path.  It doesn't need to ask everything so I think we'll see a lot more Energy Efficiency going forward as well, because this has been the most power intensive. Task is having these models that need to access all of its information, every single time, someone prompts it, instead of having this reasoning way of doing things but it's more energy.  Efficient. So it's more efficient, small models that are that are Optimised around your data or, you know, it doesn't have to just be around your data. You can have a more General one. Um, but I mean, we were talking about like, the chatbot concept is, you would probably have one a single one that you would, um, train for different departments.  So it might be that you have a sales department that needs to know about all of the pricing structures or whatever else. And I often think like when someone wants to hire a sales person. You're trying to balance someone who has got the cape, the capacity to be able to learn lots of information and re read it off quickly with someone that's a good personable and in good sales person and they're often two different types of people.  Is what you can do. Now is just get the good salesperson and give them a chatbot, or give them a reference. So that if when they're on the phone and someone asks a question, they can immediately just type that into the chatbot and give them an answer straight away.  I'll, you know, the references, whatever knowledge base that's required for their their sales department. Um or you could even I mean this is something we were talking about maybe have one that's listening to the conversation and throwing up answers. So, either the, the customers just asked a question and you're just having a conversation with, then you're a bit stumped.  You look on the screen, the chat Bots already given you. The answer, it would give Based on the information, it's got Um, so you've improved your sales team. There as well. You know, but you could have that for for every every different department, their technical technical departments can have a chatbot, they can reference their their data.  Which I suppose is that personal assistant. Yeah, thing he was talking about isn't Um, one thing that comes up to mind because we're talking about efficiency, It was also anything about the communication because we we are a small company but still we struggle with communication can be like crazy.  Like it could be so bad and it's about how can we use AI to smooth our process from like, um, kickoff to delivery because we you from the kickoff to delivery. We go. If you think about one product, it goes through every single department and then sometimes you've got some, you know, discussion back and forth between different departments until you.  You move to the next phase. Yeah. And um I don't think that we are good enough at that because I would really I think it's a mix of not being standard with our Our tools. Port communicating. Um, I think I'll compass like everything we've been talking about like, you know, actions uh, that can take actions follow up.  Is it poor communication stick or do you think people just don't have the time to communicate? I think it's a mix. It's a mix of the tools that we have the way we communicate with each other and the tools we used to communicate cuz as part of it is cultural as well cultural.  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I mean when we went first, look at the minute taker and we've envisage. We came up with the idea that you could have meetings. So you'd have different groups essentially, so you'd have the sales team and they can see every meeting that the sales team has had.  So you can go back and reference and then that can be linked to a project and talk about linking into a specific project. So you can see all the meetings, you can see what But um you said actually to be honest, we don't need the, we don't need the groups, we just want confidential or not confidential.  So the meet it the person who said at the meeting can trigger, whether they want it to be only visible to the people that were in the meeting or visible to the whole company. So in that sense, if you, if you limited it to that rather than having groups, um then the whole company can can look at any of the projects they can look at any of the meetings.  That might be a way of finding that you kind of bring everybody together a little bit. At any point, they can just list. I tell us about communication other people asking whether it's communication or it's interesting. I'm I'll say listening to AI all the time. So when they bought DreamWorks Was now back in 2008 or something.  No, I think Disney, whoever bought it. They were going to build three new factories for Disney DreamWorks, and each of those, uh, buildings had the different departments in. And the person who took over smashed the whole idea up, put them all in one building, put the toilets in the centre but a cafe in the centre.  So everybody had to go to the toilet had to walk past each other and that basically, um, Encouraged conversation initially, it's a little bit like By accident. But the more you go to the toilet or the more you go for a coffee. Yeah the more subtly social you come and suddenly those three apartments that would have been completely isolated from each other.  Suddenly now all in the same building and they're all working together and it's fostering that creativity more interaction. Yeah. And communication. Yeah. Initially by accident. Yeah, but it's, it's done on purpose. Yeah, by setting up those positions for the toilets and the calf. So you've had a bit of an arguement to be fair with um, with uh, The local Authority because the calf is outside.  The building wouldn't then be used because everyone will be inside. They didn't want to set up a calf in there but the car proofed it by saying someone like the atomic bombs. So no, is it DNA? DNA was solved or the idea for DNA came from a coffee shop where they were meeting to have coffee and that's what creates the idea of a DNA.  So he managed to convince your authorities that it's okay to put the cafeteria in there, for that very reason. So, they're now being much more creative and much more Innovative and communicative by having to go to the, by the way, the building set out as well. A lot and we're internally in our business.  We are very much segregated. Yes, not all the walls down and have one open plan office. So we're very open plan upstairs, aren't we? So I would say, you know, The, the room that we set within Agnes is in that room as well. You know, you kind of know what's going on all the time but the other areas of the business that actually we then have problems with yeah in their own room.  So for example, the design department, getting feedback from them, um or that that communication is almost. It's it's impossible. And yeah, I think it says there are different types, people are. They're very, uh, blinkered, they're probably sit in the dark. They're working around their life computers, but it's a, it's a, it's a thing you, when you're in that situation, you don't, you're not very communicative give because you are very anally focused on what you're doing and being communicative, but if you put the toilet on the side of your office, they'd have to walk through your office.  Yeah. They might, they might talk to you a bit more and it's exactly about what we're thinking about, you know, business culture, mindsets, and I think, I think there is a new way of being efficient and productive and we are asking the old way of being efficient property which is if you're a designer, you're going to stay in front of your computer all day designing because that's what your job is about.  Yeah, we're actually Maybe not. Maybe there is something different that you can add to it. That will make it more efficient, and more addictive than what you think. Yeah. You know. Because but we are so embedded into the old style. Yeah. You could use AI to just change that a little bit.  Yeah. Sorry. Support. Some of that designers. I think, I think it's like what time is? It? 9 47. Oh, that's fine. I've asked to move my meeting to 10. That's fine. Um, but yeah, how could AI actually support the design process, even you know. Yeah, the Utopia all measures in the currencies, they want to press a button and a car pops out the other end.  But AI. Uh, an a I could. I'm sure you can probably get here to set up quite a lot of the stuff you need the parameters to do the gearbox or whatever engineering or a car for us. And then do the interesting bit, the boring part is set up the package.  When you're doing a car, making sure the lights are in the right place, making sure the wheel commutes great, making sure. So they're kind of it's not that boring. So, yeah, it's actually, uh, you know, the lighting there is a team dedicated to lighting because uh, the the location of it, you don't want to have glare on the windscreen, for example.  Yeah. Uh, the the, um, just like the power of it. The colour. Yeah. You know, it's all like corresponds to the sense. Yeah. Um, and so, you've got perfect quality that gets into the game. Yeah, it's not the boring. I mean, are you interesting bit? Is that you were talking about the boring bit is trying to work out whether the right height and all that sort of improving the legal.  Requirement for the like yeah. So from my experience when you do that you spend more time worrying about that than doing the interesting bit. You've just talked about which is how the life works, what the interactive edge of the light is and how you can get it done because I've spent most 60 per time just to argue with the designer that the light's got to be these 300 mil from the ground you'll ever see it from 45.  Because that's the law because it says yeah if you could just get some AI generated data yeah saving a lot of time and then you can spend more time going because I hate how about making this like a really interesting inside or how about doing this instead. That and that I think that's where we're going to end up going.  But for us at the moment, I see, it's just try and get some low hanging through and, uh, try and get some apps that are helping customers reduce their their boring part of work. So they've got more time to be doing interesting stuff and do the intelligent stuff because it's not intelligent.  By it means, isn't it biting meatness? It's not about being intelligent, that's the boring part and that's what's about that Spencer and I think as well, it's just from like your perspective. So the one thing that I wanted to focus on today was walking through the process that we go through to raise the reposition and razor patch disorder.  Um, and can we automate that through the use of AI, do we have to have somebody sat there typing in all of the details into the system. And do we need somebody to click Send on an email to send out the purchase order because you know the way we utilise, the system at the moment or the way that the system could be utilised is, we can't use that in the way that we're set up.  Yeah. Um, And so that was the purpose of really having these guys on site today. Really, just to dip my toes in the water and see what is possible. Yeah because you know, Maisie sat there raising purchase orders for five hours a day is not adding any value. No, absolutely not.  Um from our point of view, We could create something maybe that can bolt onto what you're doing, you know, and that but then You could, you could have something at the other end, which is like a complete, like rigid, your software, completely you drop what you're currently doing, you create complete new thing that is more efficient whatever.  But then you have the difficulty of training people on that piece of software, Testing back and forth and making when it fails, you come back, whatever. So you know, you could jump on any any point along that along that really um So it's that's where the decision has to be made, you know?  It's like, How deep you want to go into it. How efficient you want it to be? Um, ultimately, the best option is the one, the full, the full full package kind of thing, but then it's it's a bigger thing that takes longer to implement and whatever else. So, you know, if you show something today and it's like, you know, when 90 of the way there, we just want this.  We just want something to jump in and send an email automatically. You'd probably need like a little program for that, but then if you wanted it to be referencing, Uh, all of your different like linking, your invoices and purchase orders together. All that kind of all automatically. Yeah. Um you need something a little bit bigger.  Really. So that's why it's useful. It'll be useful for us just to see kind of how you do it. Yeah. And and what each of your steps is Um, I think when we were thinking of working with envisage, it was It was initially. Yeah, it's like we said all of the business stuff everything we've done with Nvidia so far is stuff that you can do with every single business in the country.  You know, it's not specific to Automotive or, um, anything. But once we've kind of got over that we wanted to say, like the design process for a car. Let's start at the very beginning and go. Okay. What, what can where can we save time and energy at this point and this point and this point this point this point and then hopefully if you've created lots of little things that have reduced it down and eventually you'll get to a point like I can promise you in 15 years, you will just sketch something on a piece of paper.  Put it in, and it will generate it. And and it will comply with every regulation you wanted to comply with. Um, but we can't get there. You can't get there right now but that's where we're heading. Um but I think the way to approach it is to say, right?  Let's just let's just save time at every step that we can. Yeah. Um, I think that's what I'd like to do today. So if we can map out the process that we go through, Customer PO. I mean, I I can't do the the sales side of things, I'm not involved in that but, you know, I can give a high level all over you.  And then the bits that I know that take the time, for example, that just this morning, we're talking about contract abuse, you know, we're taking probably five people from and it's usually heads of departments. Um, to do a contract year on a piece of work. That could be. I don't know, let's say 50 000 pounds, so quite small in the grand scheme of things.  Yeah, but a lot of costs and time Associated to doing that. Is there something that can do it for us? Yes, I am my 100 uh 700 I think so. Yeah. Yeah, we're just doing that now. We're just going for June this year. Okay. So we are basically one of the novelties that we had, was contract views.  Yeah. That was implemented last year. Yeah. Now, do those contract reviews actually comply. With what? We're with the. Um, Uh, such like the um gosh, what's it called? Um and so you know, is there something you know, in First sort of train of thought is well I would just put the contract view document that we have into chat CPT and ask it to compare it to the en 900 criteria, and see if there's anything that pops out as normal.  You know. That's exactly what you that's a what you'll describe is I think quite a simple thing to make but you wouldn't want to use chat CPT. Exactly yeah what we would do is is is create you a local version of that that's on your system and that's exactly what you do.  You just all that data and actually then next time I don't know highlight if there's a risk in another contract that you then review. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's what I'd like to try and go through today. Yeah. Um and then what I can do is, you know, we can then take that back and sort of Highlight what we've been through and then how like what the solution might be to that.  Um and then have that conversation at a high level with the senior management team um and then sort of go move forward from that. Yeah. And I'm pretty sure like, you know, Other departments will soon like clock on that. You know, this is the way forward and then that that's when they're more idea generation and yeah.  And It's difficult, isn't it? Because AI It's it's so scary for a lot of people and it's justifiably so it is, you know, Terminator. But you know, well, if you get that fight, yeah, I just meant of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But the thing is the thing is that, oh sorry, sorry.  That will that will probably happen. Yeah. I know. Yeah. And before she because you are going to take away the mundane tasks, which take five or six hours which are these sort of you know, lower level. Yeah. Yeah, roles. Unfortunately, that there will be it that will happen. Yeah.  There's a couple of things which is the way I think about it is, it's more like, if your, if your company doesn't embrace it, your company will become redundant. Yeah. So it's a competition right now. The next five years is a competition between all the companies that do and don't embrace say hi.  Um, but the interesting thing I find is using AI to learn. Is you can learn so quickly. Yeah. So you could pick, I mean I've I've learnt entire pieces of software that would normally take A year or something and I've learnt it in like a month because because every time I stumble, I'll go to Ai and say, what does this mean?  Well, how do I do that? Immediate response, go back to it on. And, you know, so I'm getting that feedback in me. Normally, you'd be sitting there and then you'd go on the internet and you type. How do I do this and you get 10 different people that, you know, and you've got to find the forums websites.  Now you get that instant response, it's incredible how quick you can learn that. Um, so that's the that's the other side of it is you can quickly pivot and learn new things and and become more useful. But I think if you don't embrace it like you say, Other companies productivity will increase, massive, they embracing it.  You I mean, we're stuck, we we haven't done it yet, but we're trying. We're going to do, um, AI training because people are scared of AI. So we've got a presentation or a workshop. We're gonna run for like 60 people at a time, which shows what AI does because we have this really strenuous before, uh, one of our Direct directors came in.  So he's like a consultant now and he was like, oh, what is AI for? And he asked us where we're there. And we typed in the question he asked us, he was like, how would you cook a brace of pheasants and we typed it in and it gave you, oh yeah, I think you have the wine list on it and the dessert.  It was all like. So for him was like, certainly you can see in his head he's gone from thinking. AI is really scary. Dude, this is actually. Yeah. No. What the front. There you go. There's cancer. So they're now and so, we thought fine. That's a really powerful thing that we've changed his mind.  Almost like, that from negative to positive AI. So, we are going Ransom workshops entirely to try and get that sentiment across to RT because it's about, it's also culture is having people are afraid of it. So you have got to move for culture as well with you and not leave people behind.  But I say if you don't do it if you don't take Embrace AI now. Yeah. Well also the thing is that then the environment will come a lot more competitive as well because you know, people are reducing headcal, they immediately costs are reduced. Yeah, exactly. And they come up with better ideas because they're using AI to be Innovative.  And so suddenly, you know, That's what we've that's what we've from the time we've been looking at. That's what we've kind of noticed. So if you don't get on the, on the train. Now you're going to be left behind base. This could be the next industry. I mean, yeah, they say it quite a lot.  It could be the next. Yeah, it is. But I, I feel like it's always all very important about how you use it. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. I'm gonna use AI and I'm gonna be like, well, if you not use it properly. Yep. Oh no.  Yeah, yeah. Getting on the train is one thing, which carries you in, it's a completely different thing and you need to be doing the right thing with it. Absolutely. I think it's almost like a, a, you know, a learning in itself, a training itself about how to use AI in an efficient way to be more efficient, because I think that's where the intelligence comes in, of the people who are talking about it and wanting to use it.  Um, so you can never replace this sort of conversation with AI because it's an interesting intelligent, integrated talking about the problem. And what we really is, we Sitting here. Now when our ultimate one was working it would be telling you, those answers. Yeah. Because this is the kind of conversation.  We want to have where we're having this sorts of conversations. It's listening recording it identifying the key points and coming up with answers to it. Yeah, so that's our ultimate, what we want to be, then you can be really Innovative because if you have a problem with something, it might find a different answer than you would ever come up with.  Yeah, so yeah, we're yeah. I mean today we're I mean, we're looking forward to it, uh, just to have a conversation with like-minded people to talk about what you need and try to see if there's some ways we can come up with innovative ideas with AI to help you go forward.  Yeah, for sure. Fantastic. It's exciting. I'm gonna go to a meeting. Um, thank you very much. That was really great. Yeah, it's nice to meet you, I get more excited. Yeah. Yeah. And the good thing is you leave the meeting really energised so you're going like this. Oh God I can solve everything.  Yeah. All the problems are going to be it, just energizes you and you feel Yeah. I would be Keen to join like the when you have the wrap up. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, I not to visit something like this afternoon, so yeah. Okay. All right. Okay, take care.  Thank you. What time is it now? Um so what I thought we could do then so I'm not I'm not really prepared anything. Yeah. Sort of a discussion point, really? Yeah. Um I'm happy to sort of like put something on the board sort of walk through the process you know the old school whatever.  Um and then we can maybe talk about each point. And again maybe approach it from a perspective of like waste activity almost um where we're spending a lot of time, a lot of people as well that are involved in the process. Um and then what I'll do is I'll also show you some examples when we get to the purchasing side of things.  Um what reports we're looking at the way that the data is generated, um and then I'll actually show you the mundane tasks that we go through um on the system, okay? And you can see How long it's taking types of problems that we have and we can go from there?  Yeah. So, um, pretty much. So we get, it's really, it's probably like, very similar to what you guys know, but essentially, um, to get obviously RFQ This RFQ is received by sales. Sales will then send this to production engineering and design. The sales do anything to it first. Um, they'll review so they'll do a bit of like a feasibility study just to make sure that it fits within our capability.  They'll look at timelines, things like that. Like, when does the customer want the product? Um, Obviously, if a customer wants product in two weeks time, it's probably going to be a no. Um, but That's sort of like the human thought process, how you will probably utilise, Ai in that I have no idea, um, because they would need to look at like, production plans capacity, plans to see whether or not lead times for even achievable.  Okay, um, This this time gets sent over to um production engineering and design with the drawings. If there are drawings, if it's a make to print project. Um, From there they then obviously that's my that's where my do you know that process like what they then look at because that's where my sort of knowledge stops.  Well it tends to make the print not really. No, if say if it was like a new project. Um, Like, say for a new gearbox design would you know, Yeah, so you'd have to look up. Look at what the requirements are from the customer essentially. And that's where that's so if you say, you've got the RFQ, yeah, and you've investigated to make sure you've got the capacity for doing it.  For delivered. So when it goes to engineering, you could ask it what the deliverables are. And what their requirements are. And it will tell you, it'll read the quote for you and tell you what, you need to deliver. And when you need to do it by, Okay, I can literally show you that on my laptop though.  Like, literally the one I have created, if I go, if I get the Wi-Fi. Yeah, the one I created for this saffron quote, for this seat, I just basically, like I said, just we've got rfg form our response format, it's got same headings in all of them, you just type the heading into a into AI.  So I was using, it was a PDF, so I was using Adobe. I think more, whatever it is AI, which I've paid for and literally, it'll tell you what the deliverables are, so your engineering team. Can then spend more time not trying to work out what the zeros are but they can work out how they're going to deliver them.  So is that the production engineering? Yeah. Yeah. So what you're trying, you're trying to get a cost slightly for delivering that quote. So the cost is created by at the engineering team so he's going to take me this much time to do it and this many engineers and this is how much it's going to cost.  But but the hardest buy is working out what you need to deliver and making sure you meet the customers deliverables. And that's when looking into the quote, AI can tell you what else? Yeah. With the quote generator. We were hoping to kind of, basically, you have like a standard format for you B quotes and being able to any and specifically, then you'll upload a quote, and it will fill out there.  Yeah, even does it in the right format, it puts bullet points in for you. Yeah, it changes the text as well. Yeah. So the text is like, you know, if your taxes, for Dan or whatever, we'll do it at format for you, let me see if I can just find by 10 example, um,  Um, it's amazing. That's annoying. Um, let me just get to password. Please, have you seen? Have you seen laptops that turned to face recognition? Yeah. Yeah. Nice to hate typing in my past. Yeah, massive long, like 20 minutes. Just take forever. I stopped using it though because when I go on to teams, it won't, let me use my video sometimes because it still thinks that it's trying to recognise my face.  So much. So many phones. I refuse to have a work phone now. Oh, I said something that's cool. Yeah, I said, I don't want to work and it's like, oh you've got our work thing. But unfortunately, my phone doesn't work in America. So I have to use the work phone when I'm in America.  So, it's like, Do you travel to America? Uh yeah. Yes, I'm in charge of the I'm responsible for the American side as well of our business. I go. I've been twice this year. Went once last year. I mean, it's it's it's really good. To be fair. Um what part of America California?  But we'll say we're also opening somewhere um in Wichita so I went to, which I went to Wichita on my last trip so I sat California there so that San Francisco into Wichita afterwards. And uh yeah, it was really good. Um, I don't know which word, which is, no, I didn't know which that was either.  Igles.  I'm just having a quick look because, like I said, I don't get involved at all in the, um, proposals just see whether or not they were, um, Famous. They were the same document consistent. Yeah. Yeah. So they definitely used the same. Pettings and formats. Yeah, yes that's all standard.  Um I'm just trying to look at the content. Becoming quite definitely sometimes it's because it's the actual requirement is quite open-ended to do a little bit of work up front just to work out what the gearbox would look at look like essentially. You know, it could be, there's different types of gearbox.  You could do sort of And different types of gear. So it's there's a, there's always like an initial study that has to go just understand what we think it should look like. Could you could you have if you imagine like, a quote generator, essentially being, um, Some drop downs.  So you start and you'd say something like what gearbox? That one? What type of gear is that one that one though, you could fill in all the information and then it generates the quote, it does, all the fluff for you? Would that do you think that would be possible or is that Are they two different?  I think it really depends if it's the work that we do is so very there's no standard. No, so I've just looked at this, for example. Um, one I can't show you but there's um There's this one. One proposal. It's for a crown wall opinion. Common opinion sets quantities twos and threes off so it's really small volume.  So you've got your unit price. Literally that that's it unit, price Supply summary that your NRA and your lead time and then your commercial terms, whereas if I was to then and then obviously your quality and and warranty as well. I think I think the mate to print it would be much easier to automate it.  Yeah and that would give us more time to just focus on the very right designs. And it has to be a much more sort of. Why would you leave that human still? And I ideally then look to sort of speak about your information but there's a lot there's a lot that goes into that because let's start with the ready interpreting to save time with that.  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Because I think they're pretty standard those haven't really gotten. Well, yeah. And then yeah, they are pretty simple, so basic. But then you compare it to like this characterisation development of a transmission lubrication system and it's like, If you got a password for your Wi-Fi 10-page document, um I'm just waiting for the it guys to come back to me.  Are both of those made to print nice, right? So the lubrication testing Is like a whole I think there's there's multiple different work packages that go into something like that. So this would this would have been done by the tech centre. I guess. Yeah I think five four five yeah yeah um there's like a project plan in there.  Um Pricing summary program, giving change. So that's a lot more in detail. So I I would assume. Oh, they go deliverables. You have the deliverables for the different work packages.  Um, Assumptions and work package to design and Analysis. Engineering review. I wonder if I can just show you um, You guys don't make gears or anything. On, in my spare time. Let me show you guys them. So, what are you doing over the weekend?  Sell some games though.  Let me take a screenshot, try not to have anything on here.  Sorry, the person this guy hasn't replied to me. Uh let me try someone else communication isn't it?  It used to be on the Whiteboard. You could connect to my hotspot in the main time. No, I might have you got it on your phone? Have you got it on your phone? Because you could share it. If you connect the Wi-Fi on your phone, you can uh no idea if you've got what's his face.  Contacts details. Oh, okay. Click share. How long does it take? Take you guys to get down. Took me about an hour to get to you. I think was it from now? Yeah, I've got to go the furthest Oh gosh. Gotta drop you off in Birmingham. Was it bad this morning?  No, it was too early. It's really bad. Did you guys meet at Uni that normal? Yeah. Yeah. We met you in our masters. Yeah. Yeah. We were both the um, Student. Right student wraps up, right? Yeah, you were. You were the good car? I was good coffee. It was bad.  I just said nothing, you know, I just used to say nothing if we were talking to someone then and then when something bad, The students. Yeah, no. It was actually the the course leader that we were going up against 90 at the time she was completely useless. Yeah. Oh, there we go.  That's it.  I was always trying the Diplomatic approach and if she was just saying things that weren't true. Ben was like, well, we'll hang on. It's a waste of time. Yeah, I think. Anyway the Masters was anyway, well, we learnt a lot. We thought a lot out of it. That's because we They had a good cohort.  It was all in it. Is it corporate or guest Wi-Fi? It should be guest. Okay, I thought the best thing about University was the social life. Yeah, it is. It's fun. My friend went and um, just a waste of time. I think I was lucky because I was 1990 when I was it wasn't super expensive to go and have tuition fees.  So it was worth going back and standing out why people don't do it because it's quite expensive. Yeah. And then of course, it seemed to have done themselves down a lot. Since if your intention is to become educated, it's about the worst way you can possibly choose especially now because it's like, They just want the money now, isn't it?  It's like lost. Educative, kind of things. And it's not so prestigious anymore. Well, our course was so we've got Masters in artificial intelligence and, um, yeah, it was funded. So the government was funded those Masters courses, right? Um so the the people who created the course are just trying to fit the criteria to get the money from the government to you know.  Um, and we both had. You had a scholarship was only in other scholarship to do it. Yeah, fully did as well funded by the government. Yeah, I wouldn't. I wouldn't have done it. Yeah. No, I I was, I was, I studied Sound Engineering and production at the University like 10 years ago when I might be a lot longer than that.  Um, and I just had a thing come through, uh, If you're, um, what they call them, when you're an Alum, an alumni. Yeah. Yeah, so you can apply to do a masses in AI, see if you can get a scholar. So I might as well. And then yeah, I've got it.  Let me set the business up. Yeah, you work together quite well, you know. Um, you just wouldn't think that would you just some random email came through? He could literally pivoted my life in the whole life, like it's like the butterfly effect, isn't it? Um, right. So this is like I've just taken a screenshot so there's no data on there.  But essentially, this is all that the quote would contain from make to print. Um, piece of work. So what you have a code then for So, obviously, you want to know the cost of making that pinion, will they? Yeah, the drawing is the PA p00. Yeah. So you need to interrogate the joint to find out how big the pinion is to how big, the piece of metal, you start off with is and the process of doing it.  Correct. And it's, whether AI can interrogate the drawing to get that information. So if the gears like the diameter of 30, so you have to start off with a piece of metal, there's 40, then you can work out the cost of that piece of mail and the price time it takes to machine it, right?  And you can create a quote for me guys, if the raw material is five pounds, it takes 20 hours to machine here, 50 pounds, an hour that means it's a thousand where is pounds. So total cost is 1500 quid. Yeah, yeah. As long as you know, all your variables values, you can always get a prediction of the cars by looking at a drawing though.  If you can reliably extract. Yeah, the variable values then. Yeah. How could AI go into the drawing and do that though? Potentially, yeah, if you get the AI, perfect enough. Are the drawings consistent or are they different than different customers but it makes it more challenging and the more consistent, the input data, the better.  But the only thing is, the only thing I would say right is that you're going to get most drawings, whether you all to a kind of ISO standard anyway, you're going to get a draw box, you get a title on the bottom with some information in there about material type and stuff like that.  And then you'll get a view of what it is. They want you to make in different directions and it'll give you Dimensions from it. That'll tell you how big it is and how thick it is. Yeah. And then you'll get a gear colour type to get with it. So you need to do is go into that drawing.  Look at the dimensions and then you'll say so I'm going to start off with a piece of metal. That's this big and I'm going to machine it down to some of this be. So this might be a 100 by 100 and this might be a damage of 75 or something.  Yeah. And you would have all the materials listed in there. What materials we listed in the drawing? In the drawbar? But you can't. I mean actually quickly can you so you can say for doing it. So I'll tell you what the material is. Uh, what the spec is what?  The way is so you don't they don't tell you what the diameter is. Yeah. It's in the drawing. And do you have you have a database finish component? Size would be in would be on the drawing. Okay, yeah. Okay. So you'd have to like measure that yourself on the Droid would tell you there'd be a dimension on there that says.  So I'm saying yeah 75 right. So yeah, that's even easier. I was thinking that image. Yeah. Yeah. That so the three-dimensional picture of it will be a gear in 3D, right? And that'll be. That means you really have to go and measure it, right? Yeah. Every part, I establish drawing that's what's called main to print, okay?  You've got a print, I'm gonna make it and make it. That's perfect. You can get a drawing, and you get a draw frame, got all information this bit, you get that information in there and then you need to work out roughly. So you know, if it's 75 Wide. Then based on information, you normally start off with almost 100 square and machine it down then blah, blah, blah.  And do you also have, do you have like a database of prices? You always have the same supplies those were basically. Gosh. I think what we work from is like we have a spreadsheet and there's like, lots of um, Uh history and um like built into it. I don't I don't know how it works.  Like Would you the size of it will affect how much machine time it takes. It's about Machining time, isn't it? Yeah, that's the problem. Let's say what you're Machining. If it's yeah if it's a complicated gear shape, it will take you twice as long as a simple gear shift to a machine, but you can that'll have that.  How is that the production engineering or working of the staging? So you'll go through various points, grinding and mind building and whatever. So go through multiple stages and there should be a sort of serious amount of time and it cost for it. Yeah, at the moment, when the activities I'm working on is Predicting that more accurately.  Yeah, yeah. Right. So we can, you can provide that data, we still needs someone to look at the drawing and say this is. This is the flow. Yeah. But you probably have a, you probably have like a like, say a table full of information on the different types of of braces as you follow and it takes and in time it's this way, it takes you one hour to do this two hours to do that.  And you're saying I'm going to use that process and that process. And this and the total then total time is five hours times. The rate of the machine at 20 pounds an hour or whatever and be sure the cost you have a date you say you've got a database of Machining.  Processes and costs associated with it. Yeah. Obviously the only thing is is that it all takes different amounts of time. Yeah. Depending on obviously the size of the product we should better if it's a 75 mil diameter gear versus a 25 mil temperature gear, you could be able to show the AI can go.  Well, that's that's more expensive than that one, because it's bigger. Therefore, there's a Costa City. Yeah, should we have? So if you see the drawing, it says 75 you, then use that as a factor to then work out how long it would take to machine it. And number one, you can make these lists more accurate than what, how have you been making it more more accurately, because a piece of software, you're making to do it all.  Well, we're monitoring the, um, The energy usage on the machines that are actually doing the manufacturing. How, how much So, we can look at how much energy you've actually used, and the costs of producing a single part, or a single operation and how long they spend doing it. So, we have all that data, being recorded.  So, one of the things I'm doing is sort of trying to collect all that data together in one source because they're coming from different programs. So that would help us improve our cost estimate estimation. So are we reliably predicting the time? It takes to produce the part and are we charging the right amount?  How are you currently doing it though? Is it just someone knows. Oh I think that I think it's a little bit about. Yeah right yeah that's the difficulties. We're going to try an AI. We need some sort of consistent. Algorithm essentially like input this output that, you know. Yeah, but the thing is a gear type.  So But again, the way you the process, you go through to making a gear is the same, whether it's a big gear or a small gear, isn't it? Essentially, essentially, so the steps you're in, there are the same and the type of gear profile you're creating at a certain time associated with it.  So it's kind of standardised. It's just the person who knows how to do it by looking at it. He's just got them standard information inside his head, right? So if we have to get that, we need to get that information. Yeah, spoken to you about Kevin freak and obviously like He's like the main gear guy.  Um, the main like sort of gear designer and he's like very much near retirement. Yeah, yeah. And so, we're going to lose all of that knowledge and that expert. Those expertise. And I'm just wondering like, maybe that is an area that we to de-risk the business. Oh yeah, get that information.  Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if someone could interrogate, we could record an interrogation of him for like three hours. And then, just train, an AI on whatever he said. Yeah, but obviously we wouldn't know questions to ask him. Yeah. You know, but maybe you guys could. Yeah. Or, or you need to get him to Yeah, you can get his data out of his head format.  Some description, then we could use that data to create it. He's got like Probably like 45 years. He's been here since. Wow. Since I'm thinking about school. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, we haven't quite a few people here like that. Yeah, it's really good. Mix. They want to stay that long?  Yeah. Um, Have you tried both the guest sounds there corporate? No not just the guess one, it's cool. I don't know if you'll be able to get on to corporate.  What the gear profile might look like? So there'll be multiple drawings to look at but yeah you'd have them like Maximum diameter to look at. Is this hand drawn? Is it? Or is it? No, no card software, right? Okay. And would it always be in this format? It always been or it'd.  Always look like something like this. It wouldn't always be in his views or this is on a specific part of the two directory. So they'll be there might be Depends how you do it but there won't be a sort of a more complete drawing of that, the entire gear.  And then it focuses on his specific technology. Specifics of the gear geometry. So you All these properties of the game are quite have to be sort of manufactured to a specific terms. That's the sort of they're very precise. Yeah, it's not. Yeah. Hmm. So so You see what we can?  Train the AI to do is to extract specific, looking for specific information, like box things, and try and train, the AI to correctly box, things and label them correctly. So do you have versions of this where You've physically labelled. Like this is diameter. This is well, you can see that.  Yeah, it tells you that the diameter would be but is information on there. That's not relevant to costing. Uh, Jeremy. Is it, is it potentially? Oh, I don't know. Look at this but certain things you're looking for for costing. Like, do you need every single Every single dimension for figuring out the caution, or is it just the general outline?  I think the main would be the size. What size? So the depthability inside or the raw materials. Yeah. You have to buy inside. That'd be a big one. So that's yeah. So you know, like that makes it a lot simpler. Yeah we did a configurator for a customer request to a configurator which might be very similar to what you're talking about.  You maybe it's the other way around. Do you care? Uh, you get the drawing and you have loads of different types of Gears and your configurator, you pick the gear that's relevant. Then it asks, you the dimension, the size of it, and weight of it? Well, some questions it has and at the end of, it comes up with an answer for you.  You just have, like, seven different types of gear. I mean, it's not a million different types of gears, isn't it? They're pretty much there. Must be like, almost like ball bearings. There's only a certain number of ball bearings. Isn't there so? Is it a wheel bearing? So is there like, if there's like eight different types of gears?  Can we make a configuration that comes in the person? Then looks at it? And goes, this is the drawing. And then rather than the AI, trying to interrogate the drawer which can be difficult because there's lots of information, you ask it, you ask the person to stand a number of questions from AI a making a configurator and then And then it works, for example, unless how many of those do you have available because the drawing needs to be quite difficult.  It'd be much easier for human intervention, to look at the drawing, and put it into your configurator, and try and get AI to go into every different type of drawing. And try to find the answer and she had loads of those drawings obviously. They're not all made out of the same time.  Yeah, so you'd ask them. So one of the questions to be what materials in. So the first question would be what type of gear is it is this type of gear you select that gear then it has a certain number of questions that you would normally ask to quantify the cost to then the person then tells you puts that number is okay.  What's the diameter 75? What's the material in steel? What's this? Then it goes away. It fires up the cost for steel finds out the cost of machine that part and comes back at the bottom. The cost is 27. So production engineering will come to purchasing and asked ask for the cost of that material?  No! No! The AI order before you. And how will that, how will it obtain? Or where do you store the data for your material now? You'll just go into there and find it. Come back over there. So, if you're saying steel costs, 50 pounds of 50 pounds, That's all stored within the Erp system.  Yeah, yeah. Um but if it's a new material that we've not purchased before, then we have to go out to supplier and obtain that quote, I mean, you can even go look and you can even say you're currently buying steel at 20 pounds a kilo. But actually, you can buy it for 15 because on the open market style 15 pounds, a kilo and it couldn't even look on there on there for you instead and you know the the app the configuration for the C it's almost the same as that but you'll just do it for gears rather than seats.  Yeah, you ask yourself questions and then it asks you the questions to give out the cost and then you look at the drawing yourself. Yeah. The the more the more human intervention the more um consistent more accurate. It can be you know but You're after a human intervention to take away the variability, the variability of the drawing.  So they'll always be different. Like you just said, they'll always be there should be three views on an eye so they should all be done in third ankle projection. They should all be done this way, but that's not a waste the way it happens. So if you have a series of 10 or so questions on a, configurator to ask the person who has the drawing from them providing, they put the answers in, right?  You should be able to work out the costs. If they say it's 25 mil at 75. Mm diameter. You know, that takes 20 hours to machine so you don't need to write in 20 hours of Machining. You just say it's a 75 mil diameter. Uh Gear and it already knows it.  Takes 20 hours to do it? Yeah. Unless do you have like thousands and thousands of these images that these oh yeah, like hundreds of thousands. You could make an AI easy with that you could use the but that would be that would design you a gear that wouldn't work out the cost for a gear.  No, he means. It means to train the AI to extract the information. Yeah together. Okay. Right, well, yeah. If you've got hundreds of thousands, you could use the most Cutting Edge AI Training Systems like they would they know when it looks at the drawing. I know they're not always the same.  Yeah. Because it would have experienced something like that in the park in that data. It would know how to read that story. We'd take you hundreds of thousands of drawings and have, um, Like 20 of them as a test set and 80 as a training train train, you'd have to label the test of them.  Yeah, it would make manually labelling. So again, we have to classify in terms of certain obviously, there's different types of gears. Yes, planetary? Yeah, yeah. All sorts of ones. So, If we, if you could take all that date and say this is this type of here and then it's that's a subset.  And another subset is I don't know. What the drawing shows you so you can take away that human intervention of a person answering questions. But then instead now what you've got, you're going to look at the drawing that comes in use all that day. Trade to learn from in the past.  Then it creates The costs associated with it by then going out finding how much other bits cost so you've taken the human intervention a bit away, it looks the drawing itself, and it answers to 10 questions by itself. Basically, I guess if it, if it passes a certain threshold of certainty, like, say it's like, I think this might be the diameter and, you know, then it's like, okay, now it it once human intervention, if it's like 99 or 100, you know, certain that it knows the variable, I don't know.  So it's a bit of a hybrid over here somewhere, they've got loads, and right. There's all these drawings in here. Yeah, and they've got all different types of gears like Andrew said, right? So you're going to get, like I said, there's 10 different types of gears. There's times ten types of years and they're all different types and sizes.  Then you get a drawing that comes in from a customer that's made to print and on it, it's got the gear. Control, right? It's got a drawer box down here, perusion level here and it's called the information that was made from there near. There's some text out here to tell you some of the surface finishes, right?  All that information will be in all these drawings, but in different formats. Yeah, even though they kind of should be the same because the lyso standard, they're not. So what you're saying is if I get a cost that comes in, it's a mate to print. Right? So that is the issuatory.  Just please remember that gear. Don't worry about the interning, just make the gear. How much is it going to cost? What we're saying? Is you can either uh have your configuration like we did on the other one, we have like a number of different types of cogs on a gear type on this spinny thing.  You spin it around, you choose this Cog and then it asks, you 10 questions, or whatever it is to find out the cost at the end of it. Uh, I dropped all the same, right? Well what we're saying in this option is, is can we take the drawing? And it answers the 10 questions itself.  So this is, this is a human. This is AI and then at the bottom, there it goes. The cost is whatever it is. Pilarity from that. And this is in this information here, you're going to need to know things like how long it takes to make all this information in terms of Machining cost weight?  So you need to create a databases got all that information as well. So where would you get that from? If you've got like, you've got like a database on how long it takes to machine stuff from different types of Machining and surface finishing stuff. We do we have the structures and routings, don't we?  But whether or not we struggle with a bit of accuracy in terms of those um but the process of Um, obtaining the information from the shop floor of actual times and feeling that back into the system is currently taking place. So, so the good thing about this, the other advantage of this process is this process is so yeah, this data could all be wrong and inaccurate and it takes so long for you to get the answer that you want at the end.  But when you get the answer it's it comes out at ten dollars. It should really, really should be five dollars but you haven't got time because it takes well to work it out. But if you keep processing it over and over and over again and you keep getting the right answer, then you can start modifying these numbers to make them more accurate as you launched out, but also, it might learn itself.  So it's also a way of speeding up your quotes to give a quicker turn around. So you get your answers that are wrong quicker, they can get them right faster. It's essentially what we would want to know, are what are the variables that affect the price? So is it the type of gear?  Or is it just the size of the gear? Because that's what these questions are. Yeah. But you know that, do you know what the variables are for? How many there are? Obviously, this the wall material side, but then, it's just another material. Yeah, kind of operations, number of operations.  Um, Scrap. Yeah, um, in terms of number of operations laptops things like that in terms of number of operations. Um, how is that determined? Is it based on the type of gear or is it? Or is it come down to how many surfaces are different? Or, how would someone determine the type number of operations?  Well, the production engineer would essentially take the final drawing and then now to create sort of what they call stage joints, which is each operation. So, starting with the sort of your wall material, Milling, And I'd say this is your first operational if you can normally cut it down to size on the outer diameter.  Yeah. Then it would do certain bits of Grinding or turning just to reduce it down at a certain features. Every one of these faces, that's where they've started to get to, is to stay strong teacher or AI because you can see the parts that's in here. Yeah, and it matches with somebody in there and they've got the operations of it.  So what you say, what you're saying is, if you want this round thing at the end of it, you start off with a square thing. The first operation usually, yeah. Slightly bigger. Then you put it on and put the Cogswell to it. Then you draw the hole into the middle.  Yeah. So there's a different stage drawers, they have. Yeah. So then you get the stages for that type of gear out those that would help with that bit. And you can almost work out how many stages it mutate because you can learn from that. So if it is drawing, you have subsequent drawings That are done afterwards to show that.  Yeah. Square. I think round and a bit final round then. So do you have, do you have a database then of um Of drawings, a drawing, that's come in. And then stage drawings that link to it. So, when do stage drawings to make to print with me, I don't know what to be honest.  I this is the I think we're slightly certainly, I'm study, I don't know the full process. No, neither, I'm not. So but someone like, you say that guy who's been here for five years. He's doing that in his head, isn't he? Yeah. And that's how he's giving you the cost at the end of it.  And what trouble you've got is you haven't got nothing to replace him without the accuracy. So you need to get his If he can tell us what he's doing, then we can tell AI to do it. But but you see what I mean if he's saying well it's there are this many services?  Yeah, yeah, there's 50 serves as it never takes 20 minutes two weeks to their face. Therefore it's whatever. That's it. Then if we can go, okay well then we can tell the AI to count the amount of services and blah blah. So whatever reasoning he's doing we can tell the AO to do but we need to, we need, you know, so maybe what we do from this.  So the main person that you need to speak to would be Matt, he's not actually here this week, otherwise I would have dragged him down into the meeting, maybe what we do because this is an area as well that we're really struggling at. And then it has actually been able to get quarters out the door quick enough.  Yeah, um yeah. So, um, I just wonder if maybe We can set up a call with him. Go through what parameters affected the course. Yeah. Go through the tool that he uses currently to get the course. Yeah. Understand what human thinking is applied to the costings? Yeah. Um, and then Understand if we could then build something around around that process.  Yeah I mean yeah yeah and it might even be that we break it down. In terms of low hanging fruit, we do the low hanging fruit within the operation itself. So you go, okay. There's at the moment. It takes me. This long, I do this, this this, this, this, but this one thing is, the thing that's taken me forever and it might be the AI can just we can just go right, okay?  We can quickly create something that's going to jump in there. Yeah, save that time and then we can start thinking about the other aspects and cure value as well. Well, yeah, because you know, the rate at which quotes get are being um Generated. And then work potentially being brought in the door because of that.  Yeah, it's me an immediate way. Yeah yeah. So yeah. Yeah, okay. And then we're projecting onto your Yes, you Jesus and and after seeing that senior manager, it might be more willing to become bigger projects. Maybe transformative. Yeah. That one doesn't work. Please just get rid of it. Do you know how to um, I try.  So if you go on to your File Explorer, yeah, we will find And then um, it should come up. Click Share. Yeah. I was like, it's still trying to get planted.  God computers. Are you? And then it should come up, click share for Double click that. Then the thing should start flashing. Was it connected? Is it connecting? We had a little pop-up saying connecting to oh is it that clickshare? Yeah. Working on it.  Connect t-shirts I think it's just downloading oh there we go. Once it's connected to the base unit and um that will stop flashing and then click it and it should go red. I think. Kitty in here, isn't it? Yeah, I thought my teeth chat right.  All right, great to share it and then press that. Yeah. There you go. All right, so look, this is the quote that we created. For a customer. Yeah. And this was from 116 pages. So this is our standard format. Yeah, of quotes. And we have like, uh, there look.  So I'm sorry, I'm not very good with that.  I think I've got RSI as well for using my mouse too much, my shoulder's. Very sore. Since I have a plane Sunday league football or Repetitive strain injury from my mouse. Function is right. So this is a standard format we've had for every customer so you may get one leader I think.  But look, so the scope of work is one of the first titles, all of this is generated via AI This has all come out of the I can't. If I could get online I can show you the customer's quotation. So I've just asked it straight out. What is the scope of work?  And this is and it's written it better than I can. So, I like to write these things really well really concise because they're the first thing the customer sees, when you've done it. And if it's right and accurate, it gives you a positive start. If nothing else. This has come straight out of AI.  And there's no way I could have done that myself. It's just incredible. And then so there's this is our capability to care to feel it's about myself. But the deliverables look, I mean It tell the most critical thing they want to know you understand deliverables and this all comes straight out of AI.  Yeah, I even formatted it for me, put the numbers on the side, put the bullet points in cycle test plan, and this is just the AI out of Adobe. And it just goes on and on assumptions. Look even there's some some of these headings we go. What have we got these silly edgings for that's one that's like exclusions, what's not included?  So it tells you what's not going to do because it goes in an asset. So these lots of dynamic testing, it's always one of those things that we have a customer. Oh you didn't tell us that wasn't in the quote. This is doing it. This is literally saying this is what's in the quotation.  And then this one that's really awful. There's a high level timing which we'll be able to do design outline, it did for us. Um, Is it usually takes a good week environmental materials life cycle. I mean, we never fill that out because it was a proper aircraft thing. We had to figure out extendable for us, just straight out of the document, all of this.  Wow. I mean, that's how that took me. I don't know a day. Yeah, well, it looks professional as well. Yeah, yeah. Like exactly. Exactly. And, you know, you have to have to read through it, you do have to understand it yourself. You can't just blatantly put it in without reading it, but essentially, it helped massively.  It gives you, that was a massive cost saved so much time 1.2 million, right? But it took me. I was really dreading around this, but it took me like like I said, hey it was incredible. So that's the benefit of AI, basically. That's what that's what when we're using it for this straight away.  Um and well that's that's do you guys do quotes similar to that? Do you have like these headings or is yours? Yeah. So, um,  We have got.  That's, Yeah, I can.  And it's all standard as well that everyone across the companies were playing almost the same way. You can get them all to use, the same kind of one app that does it. Maybe the only difference is the way they put the cost in or the way they put When you get a better time, you get a benefit that there's a consistent company theme style.  Well, I'd also that just because what sales guy has done one thing, they haven't forgotten to add in a bit of important text or information or whatever, you know, exactly. I didn't say leave then it's much easier for someone to pick up that. Yeah, you could even have the AI kind of scan a quote initially, not quote um whatever's coming from.  Yes yeah. Um, And and then it could look for questions that you that you need from the customer to be able to fill out quotes. Yeah. Scan it and say oh it hasn't we need to know. Um how much of this they need or how long this needs to take or whatever and you can then just send those questions back to the customer and get that information.  And plug it into the Ai and let it regenerate what it needs to. Yeah. So this is uh, so first of all half version history, obviously you've got the tide slot here, um, Version Control, then what's included? But this isn't the same. This one. Right. Yeah, that one's they both.  This is made to print, right? That's that one. This one is, um, Lubrication testing. I think. Is it? Is that? What's got the 545 one? Yeah, it's lubrication testing. So, completely different site that's up and sells them. The crumble opinions would be manufactured and maidenhead. So could you potentially have like Three like three or four different quote generators.  For if you've got different group of things like one for the for the metre print, one of the implication What was that? I think you would need a different type of quotation Creator based on what type it is. Yeah, yeah. Project uh, delivery yes. Yeah. So that would be those were the two types or is it because you've got mate to print which is um what Craig already mentioned.  So you basically have a drawing from a customer and they say go make that. Yeah you have designed to manufacture so you basically get a very I guess that's a basic specification, really of the of the requirements for a gearbox or a gear set or whatever and you have to go and design that and so is that like a limiting?  They're not going to ask you to design an aircraft. So they're gonna it's only going to be gears or only going to be a gear a gearbox. Yeah, it could be a gearbox but gearbox could have Like one component of it or the yeah, yeah, it could be, it could be the gear.  It could be. Um, It could be the whole gearbox design, um, and with that contact casings and then all the internal bits and, um, that's quite a bit more complex. Yeah. Um, And then the complete flow of the work as well. It's not just designing it, it's manufacturing. It testing it.  So there's a whole, there's a whole there's a whole big project. Yeah. Being cheap to deliver it. How for those sorts of uh requests. I imagine the RFQ is quite detailed, isn't it? If you've asked me to design a gearbox for them, it's not going to be like two or three pages.  It's gonna be a lot of information. Um, yeah, yeah. I I would, I would say so yeah. So the thing is the difference is when there's more information, the questions you ask, give you more answers. Yeah. So if you're asking for a make to print what's the process, you'll say just five steps.  I'm just saying. Do a gearbox when it goes through the specification. It will tell you you need to do. I I thought I'll say that 116 page one. Now how you create that document from? There's a lot of information that was just a seat a table, but the AI was able to get all the information out for me.  So it tells you what you need to create, I don't think it matters whether it's a lot of a small part or a big part. It still gives you the right would you would you have consistent like consistent headings on the design to manufacture stuff? Obviously subheadings, maybe not.  But is there a consistent like introduction, objectives? Um, Because if you have, if you have the titles or in this say, you choose Quotation number one type, it's got five headings here. Quotation number two times about 15 hits in. It just goes and find chances. There's 15 heads or those five headings, right?  It doesn't matter how so you're matching, what's in the RFQ. Well, you're trying to find from the RFQ what that matches your heading to set the side. The sections that are within your head. Yeah, yeah. So what I did there was write down what is the scope and work in this RFQ and he came up with all that work.  Yeah. I think you need to have an input. Where do you input the information into the a like the AI needs to, basically ask you the questions that an easy answer to as well, unless it's in the or obviously, there's things that you need to input that aren't in the ROQ on Give up things like cost.  Yeah. You set the scope of work. It's best that AI finds out what the scope of work is in the RFQ it pulls it out for you. Then you know what the scope of work is then you can just interrogate Escape of work rather than trying to read through the whole document and then find out what the scope work is, right?  It's actually five minutes do hi. Hi AI. What is the scope of work in this 114 page a document? It just gave me the scope of work it printed it all. That was you show Mac on that green you know? Yeah that's all done by AI so so we could then initially just have it have it do the the bulk stuff and then leave gaps for where the stuff that you need.  Yeah yeah so the costly I have to you can't get away from that bit. Yeah. For the actual because there's engineering costs and there's timing but the actual what is a scapal work? So people don't understand what it is to actually go away and work out what the cost is.  Okay, at the moment, you read that RFQ, I did the wrong way around. I should have gone in got the scapal workout first, rather than doing the RF. If I'm doing the question at the end, if you've been through loads of conversations about it, Should have asked what this group of work is first, pulled it out, everyone come back to that scoop of work.  Yeah it's a standard format standard a list of things you have to do and everyone then one of the things we were thinking about is that you almost when you take the eye, take the information out of the RFQ Uh, you make sure you've got like a checklist that says they've done all those things.  Have you run. It basically have. I got a cost for this, have I put this into it, how do I put that into it? Have I done this and you tick them off to say you've done them to make sure your RF. Your quotation contains all the requests from RFF.  So I think I was really surprised how well it just read. Yeah. 14 pages and if you have some specifically trained to do it. Yeah, it's a bespoke piece of software, then you can be more accurate, more relevant. I don't think it matters. How many headings there are the type.  What the question is asking in the heading, it can ask AI can ask that question or the document and get the answers for it. So the scope of work or it's design outline, or it's manufacturing process, or it's this, it can find you the answer. Yeah. So anything matters, what the headings are?  It's just happening. Yeah, he just it's more about, it's more about having like, What, what is the AI expected to create? If I said to the AI, I don't like that. It needs to be longer. Yeah. It would generate one with another five headings if I say, I don't like that it needs?  No, no. Why would it, why? So it in that document, I've created there. It has got headings in, it aren't the headings that I asked for. Yeah. So I've got environmental material life cycle, then it's got restricted, material usage. It's all under the heading of environment. How will I typed in, what is the environmental material life cycle?  In this document? It went back and then filled all this out itself. So this could have been any heading because it's done this one up here. So it doesn't so you specify in the headings. Yeah, I just, I just no, no. I just asked those headaches, they're standard headings in all of our.  That's what I'm coming back to is like this standard headings that you would have in all of you. Yeah, potentially, I would need to confer. Yeah. I, you know, I I need to get the sales team involved and sort of open up that conversation Yeah, maybe, but it should be.  Yeah, in my eyes that? Why would it not be? I mean because we took the word their objectives and we took the RFQ that you were given, right? We just passed AI read this document 10. What the objectives? Yes he would come up with one what you've written whatever was in there plus plus maybe a bit better, maybe, but yeah, yeah, that's that's what I just wanted to know if, if they're a consistent headings across all of your.  I'm not about the main heading, like you say introduction because then you can do exactly what you're saying, you can then feed that to the AR and say, okay now generate the objectives. Yeah, yeah. Um, but it might be, if there's different types of products. My point is, it doesn't matter what the headings are.  Because whenever you ask the question of that heading, it holds us it for you. Let's do that. That is true. Yeah. If you have different objectives, then you'd have to that person would then have to write the headings for each individual. One they'd have to generate their credit games.  Yes, you can whatever. Whatever type you need it can from our experience. Yes that's true. We can create a reply, a response and standardised as you see on that document there, but more accurate than a human can create. Yeah. Especially it's a big complicated document. Okay. Okay, perfect. So that's sort of like that front end process.  Yes. Um, then what happened is? Um, so we then go to So let's say we win the the program. We then get a PO. Yeah. From the PO, we then have to make sure obviously that it conforms to what Quite was, yep. Then you go to Contract view.  Which is a really long document that you're talking about for the yeah. 9 000. Yeah which has to comply to as 900 performance. Um, From there. We go. Yeah we can do that basically. Yes, we're happy, you know, and all departments sign it off. Um, We then go to loading the sales order.  So say, almost do this.  Again this process, I don't know how long that can take if it's hundreds of lines. And it might be the same as raising 100 lines. Is that, are they creating the budgets there? For each of the different work streams in that path? Um, that document No, we don't work.  Um, We don't have like individual project codes, okay? From a budget perspective, it all rolls up into Um, Like overarching budget codes, so will be your own materials, right. And then then you run materials, you've got all the water item costs. Yes you've got. Um, Like subcontract costs. We don't have like a Five, four, five project code and then the raw material would it wouldn't get Associated to that.  It just gets well wrapped into the Iphone, you know, so loading sales order From there, we then load Works orders. Which is done by operations.  So they actually, so this is all done in Cicero, which is not, which is our MRP, This is all done in Cisco says Pro Cisco Pro. Sorry, that's why I had some PRO.  And then, from there, Then we have like a scheduling system called preacter.  Change your name. This will go and tell us based on the delivery date that was put onto the sales order. It works, it all back and tells you then when you need to buy material and start, This then gets filtered through to purchasing.  And basically what the system does in the background is obviously like any MRP system, it will. Take your total requirement deduct. What you have from stock so we don't need to even remember that. And then it will. Tell you what you need to order. Obviously, like this is the very basic process.  This doesn't include part number generation or anything like that. This is, if we've Um, If they made the product before or if we have we're just going to make the print. So all I need to do is buy the material. Let's say, Um so then what what happens from here is what?  I'll now show you on the board. Um sorry on the screen because that's easier to to demonstrate. But basically that is a really that's the really simple flow that we go through. Um, Despair. This contract view is where I think maybe we could do something. Is that the most time consuming part?  Do you think I would say that? It's an activity that we seem to be doing to take a box. I don't feel like it adds any value. Okay. Um, And I think it should. I think it should add value. We basically just skim through the document and we go.  Yep, yep. Yep. Yep. And then I'm probably the only person that answers to ask questions. Yeah. You know like what material was it made out? What diameter like, oh, we're gonna have a problem with that, you know. No one else seems to sort of ask any sort of like relevant questions.  So it's just almost just to tick that box. Yeah. To say from an a, a s Aerospace accreditation. Yeah. We've done it. Which is wrong. Yeah. Why we are doing it? Yeah, yeah. Um, So that I think should be a value-add activity and it's not option at the moment.  How can we make that more valuable? And that's because it's just too complicated to read the contract and properly, understand it. I I don't, I don't even know. I think the funny thing is, is that in most cases, we don't even have a contract to read, right? We don't have visibility that, that group, that team don't, that's actually a really good point.  We don't actually, yeah, ever really go through the contract. From the customer. Yeah. You know, check T's and C's. No, in not, not in that group. I'm assuming sales do. And I assume you do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I do. Yeah. Yeah. But I use AI. Yeah. To tell me what the risks are, you know.  But are you using the open it? I do another, aren't you? Yeah, but although I have, I have it. Yeah, I have the um, I do tick the. Um, there's a thing is yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that could be another thing, you know, like, reading teas and teas.  Yeah. Even just like taking a, a really complex and horrible document and getting nice questions for you guys to answer that, that is a value-added thing. Yeah, you could you could have it initially check for as9100 requirements. Okay. Yep. It's all good or no you need to fix this this.  Um and then and then that's done immediately. You guys have then got Time to sit and say well what other problems are there or it can generate its own questions from it by the way this might be a problem this might be a problem. Yeah yeah. Um, I think um, I think this one again, you can tie into this step.  Yeah. They will be light. Um, so maybe if we set up in like I said a separate meeting. Um, We can understand how we could better utilise this review. Um and again I think it's identifying, you know, The actual main purpose of that, you know what? What is the purpose of actually completing this this review?  Well it's to highlight the risk to the business one. You know what outcomes do you want from that meeting? You know, not just a tick box exercise. It's how was this actually going to impact us? Oh, we actually now ready set up to deliver that product in that time frame.  That's it within that's in that contract. Yeah. Have you been cut out by it? Uh, I'm not reading it properly or If there's a another value you can say to me, last time we didn't do this properly. He cost us this much money. So, Is that why they don't think it's relevant?  Because it's never really been a problem post, I think so, but that's not a good enough reason. It's part of the 19000 requirements. Well, and also when when you get to Aerospace, you know, we delivered our first Aerospace Program. Well, we probably started it two, two years ago. Um, it was a basically like a flying taxi for California.  Yeah. Um, and we If you looked at the original proposal. Yeah, I mean we they spent millions with us and I think the original proposal was like 100 000 pounds because we had no idea. Yeah. Again, sort of just thinking out loud even from that. Yeah. All of that learning.  How can you capture that? So that we don't make those same mistakes again. Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. Good point because that's that's the future for the business is to try and secure more work like that. But we you know to be completely honest we were so far out of our debts so with that we did but the problem is I think for a the scope of that program, the lesson slurge should have been done at intervals throughout the program rather than writing in because people going oh well, two years ago.  Oh yeah. You forget that? And it should have been wrapped up even probably after each like phase of the program. Um, But, I think those two we can link together. And then what, what we can do this bit is pretty much self-sufficient. Um, There definitely is. Definitely in this area.  Um, But I don't want to get into it today because it is so complex. Um, Basically we have a guy you get you get what basically a report that's generated from the from MRP so that's already using some type of um,  Like thinking it's using some type of um algorithm yeah in the background it suggests what he should load based on the demand. And then, He will basically go through ticker box. And then manually load those Works orders. And that's all he does. Yeah, just processing. Yeah. Horrible. But there is a level of questioning that you also has to do.  So that would definitely be a big win, but he can be directly replaced by, hey, yeah. Did you get did he get it wrong as well? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the amount. He's trying to juggle so many plates. That has been accumulated. Yeah, I looked the other day and I said, why on Earth have we got 215 000 pounds?  Worth of 173 where we have no demand. So what would if you had to put a percentage to it? Um how many Uh, false positives. Is he doing? How many false negatives? Gosh? That's really hard to give that information, but good question. It's just so you could put relevance against the well, we could say, you need to be within within the time frame that I was looking at.  Let's say that snapshot in times, it changes every day as well as we're loading more orders every day. A snapshot in time, say between April, and May or January and may we've loaded, let's just say 10,000 Works orders which equated to well, no, it would be 10,000 Works orders out of that, these Um, 5,000 lines were incorrect.  Let's just say. So it'll be 50%. That's how you'd have to do it. That's like flipping a coin, which you get from an AI, um, pretty easy. How would you build in the the rules? Because there's rules, set up for each component, and we have like over 3000 components running for the shop at any one time, right?  So where's where are the balls now? The rules are held, although Bad to be question, two. Okay, which is what he does. That's the human part of it is he's questioning what has been set up against that part number. So it's set up by a human again, production engineering, they'll set up like pan sizes ebqs so batch quantities to to load in Um, And he is then going and questioning.  Well, actually, we only need to load five but the ebq is 25. This the rule that's on the system is loaded to ebq. Not load lot for lot. So that's one for one is one for one. Okay. Um, Should I load 25 or should I just go and load the five plus one scrap?  Or actually this grammar opinion. We usually have a lot of distortion heat treatment Shiloh too. So what would he do? Would he go back to the production? He would go, he would go to the works order and amend the works order to stay all sorry and be like, what's shall I shall I load.  Okay six. Yeah, not 25. So what we could do then he's put an AI. That looks for those discrepancies and flags it up and then you just get the flag. Oh, hold on, what's happened? Here it gets. Bounced back to sales, they see it and they go, oh, no, it should be this change it.  And before it can go out. And that inventories, acquired that you don't need a big loss, isn't it? Yeah, huge loss. So, that's a difference where someone's about 25 in. It should only be five. So, the system has said, we should order 25. Because the ebq, it starts against the park is 25.  Yeah. But the Euro requirement is only five five. Yeah. So the system, isn't that clever to say, okay, I only To do five. It will just go how it will just use whatever setup on the park. Okay, so would you always refer to like in that example, if that happened a lot?  So would you always be going? Oh we only need five or would there be times when you said actually we should follow what the thing, says 25. Um, so for example, if then sales come back and go, no, the forecast for this gearbox, let's say we've got another 20 that we're going to deliver at the end of the year.  Could use the produce the 25 now, so that's going to be in their head. It's not going to be something that's already. So the The forecast, we have a forecast document, which is located, which is stored on the system. Um, But that is only at gearbox level, it doesn't then break it down, into all of the sub-assemblies.  Which is where then that let's say this part hns249. Would be located in a sub-assembly. Not at that top level gearbox. Okay. Um like number the forecast would say hls 200, for example. Yeah. So, so what would the sales team do? Would they go and find? All of that information.  Yeah, they would be although they're pretty good to be honest. They're pretty good at knowing Then normally it's just coming. So it's the problem. You're trying to find the discrepancies to make it quicker for him. So the stuff that's there's no discremacy. You can just post it straight away.  It's the discrepancies. It takes time, is it? Yeah, it's the, it's the questioning. And also sometimes the lack of questioning. Yeah. So him having to remember, two questions. Yeah, we've had problems in the past where, you know, That hasn't been done because you're lying relying on someone to remember and that actually happens a lot.  Actually that it is, oh, so how do you know to do that? What's your trigger to? Yeah? Oh no, I just have to remember to do it. That's not sustainable. Yeah, yeah. That's that's where the AI can do is that you could look like say the flag for things that I spot discrepancies here.  So if you've got 100 orders and then five of them have got discrepancies here. Yeah, those are the five. You don't need to remember because it's going to tell you what? Yeah, yeah, on the list. Yeah. And in about time I mean his whole day yeah yeah it's his whole day.  Well you could start by giving him a tool to do it but um  Um, is in control of that department. It's a part of the planning and operations department. She's very much, um, at the smt level, we're all very much aligned in terms of AI and, you know, all driving it from Different angles, patching and sustainability are the ones where we see low lower hanging fruits.  So they're good departments to sort of like Showcase. I, I guess what is possible. Um, I think from your perspective, Andrew as well, you know, like there are so many areas I think that's designed that you could utilise them. I think it's just about making sure that everyone has the awareness of what's possible.  Um, and that's why I wanted to start with, sort of my department and then potentially sustainability because they're already doing work, um, with Andrew on, on AI. Yeah. Um, but there are lots of areas where there is a lot of waste, a lot of non-ad value or added value.  Although they are added value, but can we do them more efficiently? Um, so that he could be, then following parts through the shop floor and you know, things like actually getting Revenue out the door. Um, so yeah, so essentially, that's the process. I think Kirsty would be very interested in this section, so it might be something that was.  Yeah. Um, she's got customer service so she can attend unfortunately. Um, but what I don't want to do is make it so overwhelming that we then don't achieve anything. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just do bit by bit by bit. So it's great to have the ideas and then as we sort of move forward and have the conversations.  Um, and also for me to, then take this back to SMG. Map out what we've been through some of the ideas that we've had and then identify like the priority for the organisation in terms of actually, you know, we're spending well we're losing work because of this process, um, because it's taking too long where and end up putting a load of inventory in place that doesn't need to be no spending money and cash tied up because of this process.  Um, the purchasing stuff is obviously important because, you know, we can potentially reduce head count Um, maybe I don't know and in finance which is obviously what I'll go on to you know, we've spent with paying a person to sit there and do that. You know she's only part time but she was brought in to do that.  Yeah. So you know it's an extra cost. Yeah yeah. Um And I think, yeah, it's just making sure that we prioritise because it's in all different departments. Yeah, yeah. Um, And then come back to you with what our priority is. Yeah, okay. Um, I think whatever we do is we want to make sure that it works from the outset it's something that people like and gets used so that it doesn't dissuade people from continuing doing the rest is I think in in these departments you won't have a problem.  I think, you know, we're quite young and diverse team. Um it's when you get to the older generation, which you spoke about at the beginning where they're worried or they're scared about utilising, it. Well we're going to have the problem and unfortunately that is within this team which is why we have the problems um because they're set in their ways that it's a cultural sort of difference between You know, the uh, sounds so bad, but like the younger Generations and the younger Generations.  Um you know, these people never time and age, they don't, they don't understand it, you know, they don't even I've just moved over to VoIP, you know, voiceover teams. And then otherwise my despite and I'm like, you don't use your discipline, you use your headset, they just cannot comprehend it, they will not use it.  They'll just go. They'll have to walk down now and talk to people. Yeah, um, so you know, that's where we'll have the problem, but that's why we have the likes of Kirsty. Our general manager in place to, to sort of them things and smooth out. Yeah. Um, so essentially, what I'll do is I'll just go through the, um, Patch thing stuff now is.  Do you guys want another drink or anything? Are you okay? Uh, yeah, yeah. That'd be nice, actually. Yeah, do you mind if I take a picture of that as well? No, that's absolutely. Yeah. I was just thinking I probably need to get an MTX. Yes yeah definitely. Yeah, this corporate spinach.  Thankfully. Awesome.  Yeah, it's so exciting. Because you can see the massive. Like, I like, you're saying that contract review thing, it would be awesome to use it properly, wouldn't it? Yeah. Here we go and drive benefit rather than we all just just sometimes you think oh my God. Yeah yeah you want to enjoy your job, you know it's critical.  You do it properly. Yeah. But because it's such a boring laborious task. You don't do it properly? Yeah, exactly. If you get it done quickly for you an easy thing, the issues with it, it makes it. Then you can then you just have a skim through and then you can be smart.  Yeah, yeah, exactly. The other thing as well. Yeah. The, uh, AI used earlier in the, in the chain, then, your contract review won't be flagging up so many problems. Yeah, yeah. Make it smoother later than one or two things if that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, right, should I go and get you another drink quickly?  Yeah. Great. Thank you, George, just found a coffee. Yeah. Just please any water. Uh, yeah, I'll have a water please. Yeah, that's okay. Thank you. Did you want anything?  How have you been getting on with the stuff you've been doing the AI stuff? That's my new developments. Uh, not really. So I'm just trying to because it's not really AI. It's more. Just some data process. I'm just trying to Shouldn't mind that a little bit. Yeah, I'm using AI to help me program it.  All right. Okay. How do I do this? Yes, you say you're doing your python? Yeah. And what what do you use to use vs code or Google collab or something like that? What to use for doing your coding? I thought it will be in that Anaconda. Oh okay. All right.  Yeah. Yeah, and then do you um, You're running that locally or just on you at the moment. Yeah. So it's all it's a little bit. So as I said well the main thing that we do is we have um energy gateways looking into the machines and they're recording amazing uses continuously.  So I take that as a raw voltage data to work out, the energy usage. Uh, a couple hours. Then work out the cost based on energy rates. And then then I can we have another bit of software. There's so many bits of software. Yeah. Yeah. It's called psyche. And that essentially is Telling you what each machine's doing continuously.  So it'll tell you Essentially, what kind of operation it's doing. So is it is actually In use, is it? So it's a cut, it's actually cutting. Or is it waiting to cut? Was it set up? Essentially map that energy usage data against what the psyche data has done. So we can then look at how How much energy are we using over the day?  How much ends are using this specific jobs? You know how much of that is actually value-added. So, so, you know, when you say like waiting to cut, why would it, why would it be waiting? Someone just hasn't, it could be, I don't know, give them reasons. Are you hoping to move to a thing where it's like, That the machines are more efficiently.  Allocated Parts and things to do to work on. Yeah. So essentially, we're trying to work out where it's not utilised and how we can. Yeah, so one is not wasting energy by leaving machines on it. Really doesn't need to be left on and the other one's just, yeah, minimising that essentially, that downtime, but it could be doing something but it isn't right?  Yeah, but this I saw it can be at the Paris in the carbon fibre thing they were doing the same thing they had Every single machine they'd sold or something connected for the things you're talking about to work out when they're going to break. So to check on the usage and the rotations and all that sort of stuff and then it can tell the customer before it breaks.  It's going to fail or when to service it and stuff like that and how much energy to be using as well. There's like real life real-time data flowing on the graph energy, the whole all this. Yeah machines were using across the world just for customers. Yeah, the information is so the one, the one, the first problem is kept getting the information capturing it.  Yeah. And then the second problem is what. Now with this information we can do so much. Yeah. If we can get, if we can get a way of it, kind of checking and Changing things and automatically allocating and all that kind of stuff. I think the contract thing, it's weird because you kind of think that you're the only company that does rfqs, but every company that, in the first tier does rfqs.  Yeah, so everyone is doing it the same. As I say that those those headings are really irrelevant. Yeah. Some of you definitely can't use AI to answer like the cost because that has to be created by the person doing it. But the other nine of it that are really slight scope of word, deliverables, uh, timing plan, all those things there, although they don't have He just needs to say to AI, take that heading.  Read that heading. Just go and tell me the answer to it every time they're heading different. It just goes for a different answer. It doesn't matter what the headings are. Yeah. Find it. You just, I suppose to what you type into into this. What? I typed into AI. Adobe.  It's just different a bit like that. Yeah, and so it still finds you the answer. Hey, oh, thank you. Thank you. Yeah. It's essentially what I'm what I'm doing, what I'm getting at is like, like, for example, if you said like, um, You know sometimes you have to generate a Gantt chart or something like that you wouldn't want yeah.  That'd be the human has to do. Yes. So that's what your deliverable dates can also be found in the document and it can find it, you have to make a game chart to work out the cost and the rest of them, but the delivery date will be in the RFQ so you can say to it.  What? What are the key dates for this project? Yeah. And it will come back and tell you where they are. So Initially. And so it's just so that would then also help you because one of the hardest things about making a Gantt chart is uh collating or collating. That's the way correlation correlating your Gantt chart to what's in the RFQ.  So if you have to read through the RFQ try and decipher, when the first base changes in the second phase Stitch and the third phase. You can get that wrong. But if you ask AI, tell me what the key timing plan dates on this planet, it comes back into you, start on the first day of December.  The first phase ends in the second of January, the third phase enters in the 5th of November. So you can then say, well my game charts, for example, I know the times of all the different phases, that's what I did for that. Saffron one it gave me the key deliverable.  Yes. So I'm wondering whether so you can't you can't get it to do the plan. No, the dates for that. So what you could do is instead of having you know, imagining just a quote generated, you could have you start by uploading your document. Yeah. It then analyses it and throws to you the information.  You need to create The bit that's missing. So it says to you, right. These are the date, the the dates and things you need for creating your gunshot. This is your scope work. Right? We have to use a CRM, which is a customer right here, whatever it is. What you really want.  Is AI to load the documents. I've got one from Bentley, right? Loads of document in. Use AI to not only write. Quotation. But to get all the deliverables out so everyone knows what they've got to do and have like it is almost like The uh I didn't ask about face there.  What you really wanted to do is get it to decipher, what the quotation is. I put down all the key things to that quotation timing so everyone can see. This is a thing like an executive summary of it. Yeah. But for the key headings and then you go away and work on those keyhoadings But everyone knows what they lockers are all the same.  So everyone. So if I go in and look at it, he tells me what the scope of work. He says if someone else goes look it tells you what the scope of work is, so everyone gets the same idea. So at the moment, We're getting shared rfqs. My bits are different to their bit because all deciphered for you before you start doing by AR and tells you all the critical things in that quote are then you can say who's doing what bit of that.  It's how how it links to your existing CRM or whether you're doing about it. CRMB is like, it's the I the reason why using CNCR is the idea is you download every. You put every document into the CRM system, right? And so everyone can reference it, everyone can see the same.  Yeah. What is trying to do? There is standardising your viewing for it. So I've got the latest issue level SIM system, I don't go anywhere else. I just look there at the moment, we've got loads and loads of folders with the data in it. So I've got an RFQ from bending.  I downloaded it. I can't put it into CRM, I've put it into my shared drive, I've sent some one. Delete, I can't get the link. That's what the guy was reading this. I can't get the link. It doesn't work because these are accessed out of access to my files, right?  Put it into CRM. Everyone sees it in the same document so my the reason for saying SRS everyone then gets to see the same one. Right? It's no excuse. I can't see it because I can't access your files. It's always in that same area. Right. Next thing that is if you get an executive summary based on the headings you need to fill out for a RFQ.  Yeah. Then you can say you can almost have an executive sort of each of the areas. So you say chime planets, it's delivers or that everyone's there, looking at the same deliverables, the same RFQ and just have to go through multiple people does it? Well, yeah, because okay. So, so, um, Nick might go, uh, I'll have a look at this document.  Um, I know got a quote from I won't have a look at it. What's the difference of this document at the baby? You won't know what they are if they're in the CRS CRM system and AI is interrogated it and put down what the deliverables are. They can go.  Oh, I know I'll go and ask the guys doing it. Hey Craig, have you got this toy? Uh, yeah. Are you sure was there? Uh, well. Not quite all of them. Okay, well when you get them so it gives the Nick level person, so you can. It. Dock information to challenge the team to make sure they're doing their job, right at the movie, he doesn't know what if I gave him that.  Saffron quit, if 130, he would know the first thing about it, right? But if you live, if we'd have had a summary created of that RFQ with deliverables of scalable workers, you could have read that seen it and then he could have asked me to make sure I'm doing my job properly.  It's almost like having that like check checkbox thing where it says have you done like who's done the cost who's underway? Who's on the timing who's done? It says he's done. Is this done? Is this done? You can tick in. Say it's done. Then he can ask the question if he's done this bit and what have you done about it?  And what's your answer to this question? And eventually we could have them take a link to all that. Yeah. Yeah so you can say to me like hey Craig, I've read the deliverables. Have you done the one for uh, making sure that the table's fireproof? Uh yeah. Well, what's the answer to it then?  Uh is this so he can ask questions and check. Check, make sure you're doing your job properly. By making some kind of. I think we can't use a CRM too because it's so clunky you can't put AI into it but number what you're doing. Yeah. You could have a quote generate a piece of software.  Yeah. And it would have at the top upload. You'd upload your document. Yeah. And then you could have a button that says generate summary. Yeah. Thing like this. It generates you can upload that to your yeah. With the liberals. Yeah. Upload that to your CRM and then you can have another side of it that actually allows you to generate the final quote.  Yes, you click on that. Yeah. It then asks for the inputs it needs like you might say load again. Exactly. Exactly. Then you get a standard format. Yeah, because although the documents themselves are quite varied Yeah, what you get from a customer? We always reply in a sane format.  Yeah, yeah, so it's not like you're gonna have to 10 different types of formats, we always do the same. Once it's the same question, whereas, you can chart loads you can chop into here, then it standardises. What? Other thing that happens is, everyone does a different different format. So some people underline it, some people have bowls.  They're always flipping different, right? You can then get go standard format, give us your Gantt chart. It's a PDF, stick it in there because it's stick it in there. Because at the moment, I don't know. Like someone asked me the day. What's the dfmea? I'm like, why are you asking that question for?  Are you an injury or what dfma was. So he he's looked through a quote Miss ready. I got. Oh yeah he was saying uh deliverable you must give him his name for this path. It's just so it just becomes more than just a quote generator. It becomes a, a complete understanding of that quote from the customer.  Yeah, request from the customer and making sure you cover everything they've asked for in a uniform way that would take forever normally, but with AI, that can all happen in that next time. The point is so much more it doesn't have to do everything does it right? You know, the very beginning it can just do we can you can hop in and enough points and you can still have human interventions.  Yeah. Yeah. But um, but creating a list of things for Nick to ask us have you done this great? Is it in your quotation? You never know how to do it. You can't read all the rfgs but if you saw a basic summary of the RFK or the variables in it, he can challenge to make sure they're in there and they get a standard format, a standard responsible and then it looks like.  If you're a customer you get the same type of document twice and it looks the same way it makes you look more professional. Yeah, yeah standardised. Yeah. It either become Super duper anal and you're making sure everything is done the same. Therefore, I imagine the working side is very good or something else.  Yeah, AIS. Do it. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. You want that? Because then then also you get, you get your business. You get your Design team or whoever it is to decide those things, you know, we want it. We think it looks best like this. It's the most modern, way, whatever and you don't need that to You know some person who's not interested in that stuff to me and they'll just use time Times New Roman and yeah yeah different formats even in the same green box around here.  Yeah. Okay. All I think it is. I wish I can fast forward two years and get to the point where that's working because it would help you. Now, it would help me. Now, yeah, I mean, this Friday, I've got to do a quotation with somebody. I'm kind of halfway through, starting it.  But it's going to take me most of, you know, to do it properly, to show it, the respect it deserves. It's going to take me. A lot of time whereas if I could be where we are now it wouldn't take that long and it still be just as I could and still be a show as much respect to the customer that you're doing the job and sure you're doing it showing it enough.  Respect that you're doing the right level of content. Yeah even though you probably never win it and it's probably it's a little bit of a high ball, all right. So but it's like I don't want to put in just a made-up quote. I want to make sure it's done.  Yeah properly. And like I said you could do a cheesy with us. Yeah yeah and also every time if a customer gives you a rubbish RFQ you could just spin it back and get very sorry, I really appreciate you but this won't go into our process. Yeah. It's four lines on a page more detail on that.  Yeah. Yeah, we just say that um one of the problems could also be but if you have that same issues you get an RFQ that comes in. And then the higher management. Don't know what questions to ask. Yeah, if they've done the right level of detail, we're always saying rather than doing it at the end where you ask what the scaper work is.  You almost ask at the beginning. What this game will work is then your boss can look at it and go out. I said well hang on this uh RFQ quite yeah it looks quite big. Have you done these? Have you met these objectives? This requested by the customer. Then they can then challenge you to make sure you're doing your job properly as well and then it gives you more of a robust quotation.  Yeah, I mean I think from Way that we Like deal with proposals. Um, It's very much sort of Dealt with just by sales and then production engine and then the design team. Yeah, yeah. Um, What type of questions are asked? I have no idea. Um, who signs it off for approval.  Yeah, exactly. Do you have like, a level? That's got, I mean, we've got like once it goes over a certain limit. So it's got to be signed off by the CEO. I think. I think we do have that impact. Yeah, yeah, um, But they don't know what questions to ask, usually, I mean that's expensive.  It's a really complicated project. Therefore they can't read the article. You understand? If they've had an executive summary of some sorts that tells them what the Liberals are. Please take a look at that and go out. Have you done these today? Yeah, I I don't know whether or not that sort of level of due diligence takes place.  It doesn't or if it's just because it costs. Yeah, the side of things, you know, they just want to make sure we're making a margin on the yeah, on the project and stuff. Um, puts that down to the fact they can't have got the time to interrogate, the whole document or is it just because they are interested in cost?  I imagine it's because they don't, they probably don't have a lot. Yeah, I'm just trying to think. So the way that we're structured is, we've got our managing director who actually came from the head of Business Development, That was maybe five years ago. Yeah. And from there, um, we had a business development.  Director. Yeah, he then left. Yeah. Then we've got another best development director, and he didn't perform very well at all. Um, he gave it all this but not, very good. Actually, we've been there, we've actually been there recently here, right? Not actually gonna get any water in the door, so he was very quickly removed.  Yeah. Um, and we now have gone back to our managing director also taking the role of Business Development as well as well. So he is very busy busy, very, very busy, but very good at selling. Yeah, what packages and all these sorts of things? Under him, he's then got like a more of a I don't like the word Junior, but Slightly more Junior sales guy.  Yeah. Very, very good, you know. Just very good at what he does. Um, I have a feeling that he might managing the managing director, signs off what he does. Whether it happens all the time, I don't know, because there was something we uncovered the other day and it was like, why are we charging that for this gear set?  Like it's we're not making any money. Um, It probably needs to be a bit more a box. Yeah. Yeah. Um but whether or not we have the right hierarchical sort of level in place to do that I'm not sure. Could we give the managing director a tool to be able to do that quickly so that he's able to quickly overview everything.  Um, and make sure that we have actually captured all of the requirements. Within the RFQ in order to make us then more competitive because yes, yeah, yeah. So what we seem to be? Yeah. Being like lapse days. You're making a tool for you. Imagine director to go to understand whether or not you've covered all the deliverables.  That's what we're talking about. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Because because then like you say it makes and they've quite experience. That's why, they're in that role, aren't they? So, they might look at it. Oh, wait a second. Are you sure about that? I've done that before. There's somewhat different, and so getting there and put into it as well.  So they feel part of the process too. But if it's a massive long document, first of all the quotes, massive and the rq's, massive, they just don't have to Archery, really? No, I think. One of the other issues is sometimes not like a former law fq. Some some have just been an enquiring email that I can think of recently, right?  And another one is the RFQ essentially changed quite a bit. Yeah. What they were proposing and actually after meeting them and yeah, seven meetings, what they actually want is very, very different. Yeah. Yeah. Is there, is there a point is there a point where it gets? More solidify that you could say, right?  Let's generate. An accurate one, or even if, if they come, if it's just an enquiry email, what questions should you be going back with to that to actually? Then generate the right amount of details in order to, to put the RFQ together? Which is your internal chatbot? I suppose, right?  Your personal assistant chatbot, um, because you'll have rfqs, you can look at yourself that you've got in your system that you've done in the past and you can find out all the questions. Yeah, exactly. So it's just putting that work because You know, some of them like the one that was shown on the screen.  I think that went back multiple times with the client. Yeah. So what do you want? Exactly. You know sort of agreeing the work packages back and forth so it's not just Then give it a number of kiwis then, almost posing a question. I was trying to answer it and then they're coming.  Okay, we don't quite want to do that. We want to do this. Oh, okay. Let you kind of answer the questions for them and be like, is this kind of what you want? And then they get a little bit back and forth. So yeah, we could, you know, you can, I think it's cuz it's related to testing.  You could do a huge Suite of testing, but obviously, they don't want to spend that much time and money. So they want to do more sort of focused area testing. So you go back again. I think maybe that's a that's quite a tricky thing to fix from an AI perspective.  But if you didn't have to do all the other rfqs quite. Yeah. Yeah. But you then you have more time. Yeah, imagine if you're trying to do five rfqs as well as that one. That's all of us. Yeah pushing too but if you don't have to do these because they're all being done by AI, just means you can focus on that one.  That is maybe quite variable and they didn't the answer to what they're after you. Yeah yeah I don't think I don't really have understanding because I know the ones that absolutely be involved and they do take a long time but they're very specific and very I don't know how much You know, we spend on MetroPC and our future.  I had a hand over sent to me from a production engineer. Please help me how long everything was going to take.  So roughly, so rfqs For me to print a roughly taking about two weeks which is too long. Yeah, it's too long. Wow. How long do you want it to be? Okay.  Because all you're saying is here's something I want to make the reason why it's probably taking two weeks is because it's not it probably might only take a day but it takes two weeks to do it because you've got those to do the same way, where's resource? That's all it is just it's just, it could be a day's worth of work but over two weeks.  Yeah. Just because of timing. Yeah, yeah. So it currently takes two weeks, roughly I'd say. In some sense, just imagine that if you get that down to a day, the time save the money save Is possible to get down for a day. I think, even 20, so it's like 20 minutes worth of work really?  Yeah. Yeah. The angel was you do need a period of time which you can't put a number on. Just, What's the word? Yeah. Honda's not the right word. It's kind of like just to reflect on it before you press the button and send it. You mean the whole of this process is two weeks for no no.  So so from that RFQ So from from RFQ I haven't put back on this. Obviously from the RFQ to the quote generation to then send the quote back to the customer. Okay, that's after design, isn't it right? Yeah, that's after sort of you've gone through design and production engineering to understand how long it would take to produce.  Oh yeah. And then and then you might win it and then the rest. Yeah. In that time. Yeah, yeah. So it's a quote generator. More than we getting close to two for some at the moment. Yeah. That really shouldn't be that long. No, not till not at all. And just to scan through a generated like what was saying, you know it, your brain is so much more engaged to scan over than to be monotonously going through, maybe ignoring this was like a drawing.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, God. I mean. See. Oh, sorry. I was just saying, we, we need to, we need to see how easy it is to take the information out of the drawing. Yeah, we might need to label, right? Did you set? Um, not necess is not necessarily.  Not necessarily. Um, in terms of actually pulling the information out, I don't think that will be too difficult. Um, I just think, I think the the answer for if you go back to that is to Is to ask the question of how they currently cost it. What's the first thing you consider?  And then what we do is you get the AI to look for that thing on the piece of paper. So it's going to be okay. The first thing to consider is diameter, so it's basically discounting everything else initially, just leave it on once. It's found that it finds the second piece that whatever the second most important and then comes out with the the thing.  Um it won't it won't need every bit of information on that page one things we've learnt actually and what we've been doing is that it's really, really important to set out the process and get all of the criteria from the beginning rather than to try and go back again and do it afterwards.  So it's almost like a case of plan plan, plan, plan plan plan do rather than plan do plan. Do your party. Yeah, it's just really inefficient. So actually a lot of the time is taken just to work out the functionality of what you want to do basically. So we spent quite a lot of meetings just talking about some other just seems like a waste of time but actually when we actually looked today, it did improve the functionality while I'm talking to other customers when we did the minute take away.  Also got some ideas for them as well. Yeah. So it might take 10 weeks to do of, which only four weeks is coding. In six weeks, is doing the functionality. They're basically writing it down on paper first to show it what it's going to do for you before you then go to try, okay?  Yeah, I think, um, I think this is one thing that I really tried to push especially from like my department's perspective is gu It down on paper so you can visualise it. Yeah. Yeah. And also, then it might highlight areas that you can either remove or take out or you know what, why is it taking us two hours and one of the sort of big tasks that I was involved with in the previous company was actually the business process mapping from literally that process with all the intricacies, you know, what systems you use.  What, um, what, um, reviews, do you go through, you know, all of these and the amount learning that I? Yeah, yeah, you know, yeah, experience a game just from doing that. It was just, yeah, it was just crazy, but, um, I'm really interesting and that's what I tried to do here is just get it on paper because then even if you're off sick, someone can pick it up.  Yeah, and it's much cheaper paper. Yeah, exactly. They're doing all the computer program. So you said once we've kind of you've figured out, I mean, kind of what are you getting there? Really, that, basically contract review seems to be the first thing. Probably. You're going to take that too.  Did you say a team that To decide whether or not to go ahead with it. It's not to go ahead with it. It's to make sure that essentially One that there's alignment to the the requirements are understood by The Wider team because the Requirements up front and aren't necessarily discussed at the RFQ stage because we might not get the work.  So, you know, you wouldn't do it at that point. And if there were special requirements, then obviously that they would be discussed with relevant departments. But as a general rule, Um, it's to make sure that we're all in agreeance. We all have the correct understanding of, let's say from my perspective.  Okay, we need delivery by X day, um, it's got some bespoke bearings in it, you know, are we gonna be able to Source those bearings? Who would we Source them from, you know, those types of conversations that opened up in that contract of you meeting? Um, any special requirements, so, you know, do Parts require traceability?  Do they mean cfcs? Um, A lot of the um like inspection criteria is also discussed so that would be done with quality team to make sure that the quality requirements are understood. Do we even have the right equipment to carry out those quality like requirements? Um, you know, do any special gauges or things like that?  Um, from an operational perspective, you know, we've got eight weeks to deliver this. Do you think that that's going to be possible? Um, and that's then an opportunity for them to say, no, no, we're not gonna be asked to do this in eight weeks. We can do it in ten.  Then we need to understand. Okay, where can we claw back the time to then? Make sure we deliver it Nate. So that's sort of what we go through in that meeting. I can. Do you have like a standard set of questions? We have a template. Yeah, let me. Um, Just thinking.  Yeah. I've taken a photo of that. Yeah. Do any watercrate?  Yeah, like if you have like You create a screen, it's got the RFQ on it, right? It's got the customer name on it and what the ROQ is, then you have a status for it across here. And you can say, let's in review, whether it's been processed but I don't.  Yeah. And you almost want like another document another page, which then you click on that RFQ and it's got the number of different parts to it. Right, you can then select so you just split around what this one is. This one is deliverables. This one is objectives, this one is a cost and you can almost like if you're the boss and you want to see what this what's going on with this RFQ and what state is it?  Tell me that you click on that takes to that page and you just pick on that with there and it tells you what the deliverables are for that part. Widget it's like projects are not a project management tool project information. Yeah yeah and then everyone can access this and everyone in the business can see what this RFQ is.  And everyone new one, gets to put on it, gets loaded in by a by AI, always medium stay with us. It creates one of these wheels or some visual way of seeing and then anyone can see what's inside it. So you're clicking on the RFQ to get to that.  Yeah, yeah, this is rfq's. This is all the ones you're getting. And as you scroll down, there's more RS. Yeah. Yeah. So just go on forever and then you click on that, click on that. And it takes this page here. Always then you've got like this kind of, so those are the arteries, these are for the entire company.  Yeah and this one is a separate page which tells you what's in that RF? That's really an entirely new tool, isn't it? Like an idea like it's like, um, and then the boss. Literally can go and see that one, then, check on that. And then would you then if you're then using it, would you then click on that document there and then give it in another window?  And in there it will tell you what it deliverables are from the Contracting more detail, then you could then put your content in. But then that will all go together when it's all finished summed up to make the RFQ So in some ways here, this will be all the pages that you've created put together into one document.  You've lost me a little bit there. What did you get done? So you, you said the RFQ that's been pressified, because yeah, this is the status of it. These are these bits here, right? What the status of them are. Um and at the end of it, that's the finished document.  You click on that. It takes you to this page. So if you're on the boss, you can see what the Liberals are. It opens up? You see click on the deliverable, so we should put one set. It tells you this, what the roubles are, yeah. And if you're working on it, you're cooking it a different way.  And then takes you to a page and then your it tells you what all the labels are from the text. And then you're then creating your part of information that you're wanting. Then that page goes into, what's the point of anyone making that if you've already got the deliverables from AI?  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It might be that. You just started the same as that. You just making sure that you understand in detail what they are. Okay. Agree with it. Yeah. And this can be a check to make sure a human has reviewed it as well, right? Yeah. Sorry. Okay, it's just it's trying to get a platform where everyone can see what's going on.  I I Mike. So when we do have a high value one, and you have to read it, they literally have to go through. Like 20 pages of stuff to understand it and it's just, that would make it so much easier. Yeah. Sorry okay, it's fine. So many ideas, isn't it?  That's the most annoying thing is. I always go so fast and it's like my God just get on and get this stuff made. There's so many businesses in this country that could benefit from that stuff, it's just crazy. UK businesses, do run, pretty slow, with adoptions business opportunity though.  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah.  But this is the contract view document So, it's got the customer post number. Um, Yeah, I don't need to go through that, that's basically. So this is all filled out the department. So who's who's involved? Um, at each stage and you'll put a name against that. It's just being filled out manually.  Yeah. Uh, payment times, obviously contract value NRA. So that's the commercials So, what would you have in payment terms? That would be, like, whatever the payment terms are from the customer. So it might be, oh, look, when they get paid up front. This is this document that you said, people aren't doing correctly, right?  Yeah. The contract review. Document is a tick in the Box. Yeah. So then you go through and then You basically go through who the department is and what the criteria is so. Have the customer terms and conditions been reviewed where they'll go through and put a yes or a no whatever they've done discussion and the opportunity.  So that's Before, you know, they've released the RF, the early, quote document, Um, And then they might put a link in for the T's and C's then project management. So they'll have the criteria. So is the scope defined. Um, To complete the feasibility review. Are there any special handling packaging techniques.  So basically it's just all the criteria that we need to and the due diligence that we should have, done what we have done. Do you ever do you ever just tick the box and just say, oh that's fine. That or do you actually make sure that those things are like is the scope adequately defined completely review.  I will be, I will be the first person to say, Evidence that you've done that. Right? Okay, because sometimes I think people just go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know and it's like well have you or not? Sees are almost a question. This is just this is checking to make sure you've done the right amount of due diligence on the yeah.  Quote. Yeah. And you do this after you've won, you've do after you've done it, it's not a bit late. She did it before. You send me quotation. If you win it, and you've lost and you've messed up the air, you're troubling, I mean, you could do, we could do that, can we watch that you see that?  That's what I'm saying. That that box with the hash is in that is, that's that essentially, it's the RFQ your quotation for the RFQ, but all these questions here. You're asking, are we supposed contract? You should actually be reviewing the contract. Yeah, yeah, sorry. I thought when you send a contract, you I thought you were going to show me a contract that a customer sent to you and you're going to read and you won't, they read through it to make sure it's Tech legally, okay for your company but you're saying this is you're reviewing, your are your quotation after you've won it.  Yeah, we're checking that these. These this criteria has been captured within the quote, after we've won it. But he's not, he's not already signed then because the quote should be a preliminary, right? Okay. Yeah. And the contract is then what you sign to legally, like, okay, so it can change.  It's like the questions. Yeah, she got it wrong. If you haven't got a dfmu in your cost and it says you need to do a dfmba, it's too late. You've already got the contract. All right, so you've got it wrong. You have very tricky conversations. Oh, I'm really sorry.  We've missed this. That one proposal, which is very embarrassing. That's what we wanted but that but that's what you're saying. There is exactly what we're trying to do. This here is what we're trying to say. We want to put into our okay so that our boss can read it and go I know all this has been done because it's been yeah that's what our that's what.  Ai app. That's what our app will create. Yeah. Do you think, do you think that process can be done in 20 minutes? The entire RFQ but look, it does enough if it's doing all this stuff as well, right then it can be no, but you earlier what are we doing?  Is when we get the RFQ in, you ask it. That those questions you've got there. Yeah. What's design? Engineering content? What's the product engineering content? It goes in and tells you what the content is, then you've got your list of deliverables there. So then your boss can say to you before you submit.  Have you done the um dfmea. Is there a dear for me on this quote? Yes it says oh I've got that in the combination before you submit it. I'm trying to put that. There's a new thing as well. An AI called agentic AI, where you could have like a Ai agent where maybe click a button and it goes through.  And it answers all these questions by checking this document. Okay. Yes, against this. Yeah. So your final say, if we create the RF, we create the quotation before you submit it. You do what you've just said. And against those questions there, then it could answer it for you and tell you which ones you have and which one you haven't done.  Yeah. Then just give it one. Last four years. You ask those questions. And then if they're missing, Someone says, oh, you can't submit. Or you submit it knowing you've missed it at least then, you know, you might have a problem in the future rather than finding out backs and afterwards.  But this is exactly what we're trying. This is what I'm trying. This is what we're trying to create. This sort of document that says I've covered all the requirements being requested by that customer in the quotation. Yeah, I think the problem we will have probably just the way it's a lot of your over email and that email won't be recorded these things.  So we'd have to, you have to have some disability in how we recall today. But you wouldn't fight by have a hundred thousand pound project via email object, not necessary email but it might be like They was oh I've given them I mean they might be new backwards about a certain one of these items or something and that would only be recorded on email.  But if you said, so when you get the RFQ in, if you had the RFQ come in and you asked it all the questions you've got there. Yeah. And it tells you, I have to do that after that, you have to do that. That's not going to do that.  So you say is the dfma required. It looks for it goes, no, there's no different requirements and it says uh, is the juries required? Yeah, this drawer is required. Then you have a checklist of all things you need to make sure it's done. Yeah. And then and then and then I just think that sometimes we get the point where you, because you have this, I haven't been in many of these meetings, but it's like, A single person will know the answer to say.  Yeah, I have that. I thought see what see that that this comes back down to communication is people. Take control of certain topics of certain areas, they'll discuss it on email, the only person that knows about it. If that was me. Uh, what I usually do is, for example, if a supplier if I'm having that conversation update your quote to reflect that?  Yes. Yes. Or okay. You need to update your proposal to include that as a deliverable. Yeah. Whereas that's not happening. Yeah. Is it then clearly? I don't think so. No. I wonder if you could like because any any, oh, sorry any. Uh, Anything that's discussed regarding projects could be CC.  Like a specific feature is that it's not legal. So if you write it via email, you're great via email, it's not under contract and you sign a contract based on what's in the RFQ. It's not technically legal so they could say. Yeah, but I sent you an email to say that email or she's not in the content.  You know, you could CC like you had a rule in the company, you say, cc2 projects at Hulu and whatever and that one email address gets all the information about every project come in anything specifically discussed in the projects whatever and then AI could be scanning that and then you say regarding this project, is there anything in there?  Add it to AI. Always has access to certain uh emails. You send it, you send it to projects if you agree, something via email, like Andrew said, you've agreed to change it from six to seven, but it's not good. They're not updating the contract, but this is like they should really update the country.  If they do, if you copy this address on it, check whatever you can call it it go. Used to that as well as the customer that you've got it written in AI and hopefully AI can pull that out and put it and put it in the quote or at least include it in a additions or revisions or something.  But this, but this is, yeah, this is this is what Yeah, I'll put that in. So you almost say those headings there, it says design, engineering product, engineering, they're almost the same type of headings as an rfqs deliverables, scooper work content. Yeah, yeah.  I mean, yeah. But I think part of the problems are telling that being molecular cases having the contract review after you won the project. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That then creates problems because I think we had one recently where essentially It was some sort of computer it needs a specific part to be bought in.  Yeah. And whose responsibility is to Source that part. So you've got muddled right. I think they call it bazaars and we thought it was there. Someone dropped him? Yeah, I think someone was on holiday. So the first of the main communication? Yeah, was lost. So, Unfortunately, I think it's not there.  Has kind of been resolved but really yeah they should probably never should have got to that point. Yeah. And also if we were if we were having to buy that in how we recouping the cost. Yeah, exactly. You know, maybe it didn't go that way. Anything with these things is you are becoming incredibly accurate.  You're quitting. And that doesn't always win you, the work? Usually, the ones who mess up, so, no, they win it and somehow, they still manage to make the money out afterwards. We just lost a quote to the company, the undercast, massively and then realised, they've got all the work wrong.  They're asking us now to do the work. We were going to do for another customer but this is then but they won it and now they'll somehow they will make money out of it, but we were too accurate. Therefore we were too expensive so there is a downside to more accuracy and more this small stuff you don't miss things out.  And your cost is more however, because you're more accurate, you're saving so much time. Everything's cheaper. No, it's not because I'm in the world. No, but I meant, I didn't mean to. I'm talking about across your company in general. Yeah, yeah. You no longer have to pay someone all these hours to do something, but you don't win the work though.  Because what I'm saying? I'm saying the actual quote. Yeah, the quotation's quicker. But The more accurate you are with your cost, the more, the more expensive you are. Because people who are taking a level of detail that you're going to, don't make the numbers up, quite make the numbers up, rather than calculating them, I want you calculate them.  They're usually more expensive than ones you make up. It's just an observation that I've noticed that we are more expensive because we do it properly. So it's just an observation. Yeah. When you heard these sort of things don't yeah. But then but then It should give you the opportunity then to Benchmark against, okay, you've got accurate costings.  What can you then do to drive your cost down? Yeah, yeah, exactly, maybe, maybe I know it's going to cost 600 Grand but I'll take it at 550s need the work but at least you know that 50k is gone. Yeah, rather than saying I'm gonna do 500, you can make an informed decision or you can say Barry's costing us a hundred thousand on this and he's and what's he really doing?  Let's make something with AI to replace him and then you can start undercutting people because  Just if you go through these several doors, it's literally just on the left. Um, so yeah, so that's that document. And Basically go through, do we have a timing plan? What tool? And fixturing supplies risk and opportunities? And then whether or not, we've recorded them on the week. Is that really is your checklist for your quotation, isn't it?  Yeah, yeah. It is maybe that's why people are just going through because they don't want it to be wrong, isn't it maybe? Well, it's wrong. Clicking it and it being wrong. Yeah. Um But yeah, that it's like, it's, it's so important. Like the questions that are being asked, are so critical.  But yeah, maybe at what time, it's being done and also contract reviews, you should be reviewing the contract. Not the Not the quotation. Yeah, I think one of the things I like to try, what I want to try and do with what we're doing, is time flip it around the other way.  So people want to answer the question they want to say, hey I've done that. I did all that work. I've done it but they can't do it because they don't know. They don't know. They have to do it. Yeah. But use an AI can help them. Make sure to do the job properly so they can be proudly.  Say yeah I've done that and you can ask are you sure? Yeah and he can speak back to you with great knowledge. Yeah about the answer because they they have done it. Yeah. And AIS helped them. Do it quicker and easier to do rather than thinking it was a bit of a buy to.  I'll just keep talking. Yeah, yeah. No, I've done that. I've done that done that. Yeah. Well also also Phil, um, That actually, you know, The risk that we're willing to put on the business is for Less because we've done the due diligence required. Um, and I think, sometimes people forget that or like Christmas bones in it at the end of the day, how much every time you lose money?  There goes your Christmas party, you know? Yes. It's it's You've got to you've got to put value against it as well. Yeah. It's more motivating. Working with AI, isn't it? It feels like you've got your body there. So I did that quotation thing for that. Where in London, I was just like, wow.  Yeah, I can't be how quick I did that. I really felt like achieved myself. I think, well. Yeah, and then I can, yeah, sometimes I think that like I'll, you know, if I get a really tricky email to it that I need to respond to from a support. For example, just when you do our I.T contract with a new provider and the guy that from the previous company, very emotional guy.  Um, lots of sort of Anger and sort of yeah, lots of frustrations and emotions that came out when we, um, said that, you know, we weren't going to be renewing, um, and come back with sort of all the types of things, not emails, and I just was like, write me a deal with this guy.  Um, get your burn box. He didn't reply. It's funny, really, because emails are just going to be AI communicating. Dead internet Theory. Like a lot of Facebook is just box a face of of AI making posts, then it's AI commenting and then, oh yeah. He's getting pushed because AI's liking the things AI is posting.  Now it's like Facebook is just AI Facebook. Yeah. Why did you do that to yourself? So many more things somewhere behind my thing, what software is that this is called click view. So this is reporting software. So essentially, um, our, what time did you want to stop for lunch?  If you guys faster? Should we one o'clock? Maybe? Yeah. So, Essentially, what we use is this is Cispro. So, it's a South African Erp system. And this is what I was saying that this front end piece, where they load the cells, all down the works, or does that's all done on CS Pro.  Oh yeah, yeah. So, it's a very clunky system, to be honest with you, I've come from I come from like South and things like that. And that's, yeah, this is just a bit clunky. Oh, Um, well, you know the gradients and the design the UI is like very uh I see we spend quite a lot of time with a minute out designing.  It that's the fun part isn't it? Like the colours you instantly you just you've got a down one, haven't you? Yeah. We spent a lot of time making the colours right there. Now I made it Outlook quite and it was it's super important because other people just don't take it seriously.  Yeah, I know. Yeah. All the cars, the edges. Yeah. When when I had a new girl joined the team, uh, probably 12 months ago now. And she Literally within her. But she says I don't think I can do this. I was like That's probably quite normal sort of action response humans.  Yeah, I was like, what's like, what's worrying? You said the system. She said, it's just so hard to navigate. Um, and that's immediately what people think? You know, I remember when I first I thought, oh my God, what the hell is this one? Like the Dark Ages. But before I found out that they were still working on paper like eight years ago, I was like, you're joking.  Um but she's got used to it. She's like now now I know how to use it, it's very easy but yeah, very comfortable. That's why it's important to spend a bit of time, writing down the process before you start actually physically doing it. Yeah, typing into. Okay. Just to make those make it so that it is intuitive to use.  Yeah yeah. And I think as well as removing removing all the things that don't need to be there. Yeah, yeah for my review of because we looked at minute takers that are already out there and a constant criticism of it before we went into design was why is there so much going on?  Why is there all these electric buttons? Why? Yeah, these things that no one's ever going to use? Yeah people just one is you know like a click of a button or something like that user friendly is. I think there's a natural curvy start off with this and then you kind of put all this function into it then you realise.  So you kind of have to go over that. Hump to get to your end. You can't go straight there but essentially you take them. Yeah, yeah, right. So essentially, after the works order's been loaded this Does its thing and it tells us it tells you essentially, what you need to order that then talks to this system, which is called click view which is basically just a reporting system.  Now we have hundreds of reports on here and the reason for that is because the Cisco reports that are generated are clunky. They're not very user friendly. Um this is much more of like a That more visually sort of. Um, easier to use reporting system. So that comes this comes after load works and before pre proactive pre-active.  Um so that you know this comes after after all of that. Yeah, oh okay so this is the purchasing side of it. Now So this is called The netting off dashboard. It's a supply and demand dashboard. And essentially, what it has on here is it has your part number?  What the part is. So this is a brought out product. So it's a spring, um, the serial method which we don't have on for ware items. Um, Whether or not cfc is required, who the supplier is what the lead time is and then the safety stock that we have set up in this case.  And in most things, we don't have anything to store. It then tells you. So this is the week numbers. So essentially the week numbers in, which either the demand is required or the order is required to be delivered. Um, and we've got so I'll just run through it. So this compression spin, we've got five in stock, um, as of today, Uh, we've got no supplies.  We've got no POS on the system. We've got nothing coming in. We've got no demand on the system. We've got no sales orders, so demand for Job demand for jobs. So for gearbox, builds are different from sales orders for spares. So, sales might have sold just a spring to a client rather than a whole gearbox not using fat spring, um, which then leaves us with a total of five in stock.  Did you did you create that yourselves here like the different different headings? Right? You made your dashboard? Yeah. So we have a guy who runs all of our system business systems and he's very, very, very clever at like writing or coding. Yeah. And he has generated all of these reports just through writing his own course, and it's all extracted from that sis spray.  Yeah. Yeah. So let me find one that and it's all just because CIS bra is too complicated to use. Yeah. Well, and also what I'll show you. So um So, I'll just quickly show you what it looks like when we don't have stock. So, He'd expects his Sprite to give you the dashboard near themselves.  Yeah, you've got a lot of stock and not borders on stuff. Like the 87 there. Yeah. What you have to remember, we're just explaining uh, we're quite, um, with low volume, low volume manufacture. And so in a lot of cases, um, you have to buy minimum order quantity. Yeah.  And when you just want three Springs, yeah, you have to buy at least like 20 in other ways. You're charged. Like it could be 15 pounds for delivery and the order is only two quid. Yeah. Yeah. Um, So it's a juggling act. These parts are very, very, very cheap.  Like they're not, you know, they're probably not even 100 pounds, maybe some of the bearings but not not Springs, and things like that. So essentially, this is how it would show if we had a shortage. So, this product here, this shoulder bolt, Um, we've got nine stock, we've got none coming in.  When we need it to come in, so that's this week. We've got. Um not nothing needed for gear boxes or production, but we have got 10 that needed on a sales order. So the customer needs 10. Which means that we're negative 10. We then got 20 coming in again, probably moq Um, which then deducts this 10 that we need to leave telestock?  It's like, really quite simple. Yeah. Yeah. We may have stuff in a redundant Warehouse, um, which is still on site here and it's everything that's basically been written off. So it doesn't have a value against it, but it does mean that we can use it, um, for production. So, what we then do is and this goes all the way out.  We've got orders loaded on the system four so like the next 12 months, um and it helps us make informed decisions in regards to, for example if they're if that spring was a minimum order quantity of let's say 50 but I actually don't need 50 right now. I can see that I still need 54 by week 49, I'll take the decision and I'll order 50.  Right? Because there's no point in paying a higher price. For a tiny quantity. I'm paying a huge delivery fee for something that I'm going to use, but just later on down the line. Yeah. And mostly that will be pulled forward. So there isn't any risk to the business. Do you usually just order as soon as or do you have timings like it's the things you predict when things are cheaper and more expensive.  Um, so we don't no we don't do anything like that. We don't do. Um, Any like hedging or nothing? Nothing like that. It's, um, we sort of look 12 weeks in advance, um, and that's it raw material. Even like, we don't really predict, you know, we don't buy when it's cheaper or anything like that, because, It's too much, isn't it?  We just thought that we just don't have that skate. We're like we're just not at that scale. Is everything UK bought or is it um most of it, a lot of the material comes from overseas but it's stocked in the UK. Okay. Um we work with one Mill out in Austria and there are main sort of um, Mill our main material supplier.  Um, but they keep stock here in the UK for us. Oh, okay, cool. You don't have to worry about currency conversion and things like that. No. Nice. Thank God. Um so yeah. So that's that's that basically. And that's sort of like the the human side of it. The decision making that goes into.  How many we should order. So, if we could do anything with this, In terms of taking away that human that that human element that would be great. Um, We've Andrew's written us. Um, A, what was it? Was it a Mac. What was it? A macro? Yeah. And that basically, because we basically have to go through generally it's out and then we delete all the lines that just didn't have a problem and it was just taking like well there's there's probably about 300 lines on here.  So for somebody to sit and just go through that it was yeah, it was crazy, looking for a dashboard of a dashboard, okay? For a more summary of this, that's what we've got, isn't it? That's what you think that's done. Yeah, it's still taking it to take it out of it into Excel run the macro.  Then it the macro just tells you what you need. Yeah. But it's still there. Still a human process of explorator XL. Yeah if you could automate The whole process. Then I also say now, the AI didn't change the order. Yeah, automatically sends the order. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah.  Okay, that would be great, you know? Um, if we had if you had some rules essentially, like, okay, if the order is within is this we're gonna have, uh, that product within the next six months. This many then order. You know, old, however many. Um, but if it's beyond that time, don't order that don't order it.  Yeah. You should go through what you're saying. Yeah, just automatically. Yeah, look at the minimum order, quantity, look at the lead time, look at what you need to order, and what you've got in stock and you should be able to. I mean, we can work out. Yeah. We could sit and do ourselves maybe because it's a range of times.  Well, exactly. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely making it day by day. Every day you come in, you press the button. Lift it up at all these today. Yeah. And if there's a lead time shortage. Yeah. So for example if we don't order today yeah by week 22, when it's needed. Yeah.  We're not going to have any stock. We're going to be running. Yeah. So can it build in that type of function like that functionality as well? I suppose once you've got it ready after a period of time, it will always be accurate, won't it? Yeah. You'll never have a red, will you?  No, because it won't require a human intervention to check in this one. Yeah, every day after two or three weeks or whatever. Obviously time is, you'll stop having that problem, because you'll always be ordering it in advance, any weren't you? Yeah, it takes 12 weeks to water it. Yeah, we're looking 12 weeks before and Audrey.  So if he says two weeks on top of that, so 14 weeks before you run out order. It whereas at the moment you'll get into like week 11, then realising it takes 12 weeks to order it and you're a week short. How are you? That's right. Oh well we try and not do that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. Whereas if you have AI do for you and never do that. No. No. Because it takes out the human intervention. The only thing is who puts into how do you put in your demand. That's driven from the system from the works order, right? Okay, so that's all we are.  Yes. Well as accurate as it can be based on how we operate AI to do that for you as well. Yeah. Yeah. That's easy to do that, isn't it? It is easy. Yeah. The question is just. Yeah, the question is, where do we bolt AI into it? You know, can we bolt it onto this piece of software?  Yeah. Is there a separate piece? This is just uh because they've written this themselves. I've noticed no, this is South African, isn't it? Oh this is your own. They've made that. Oh okay then yeah we could just the the product isn't click view isn't our ours but the report's been written by Someone upstairs, right?  Okay. So then yeah, going to click view sift through all that data up, which bikes are going to run out and all of them. Yeah. I mean it can be doing. Yeah it's just that's that's the question is where do we? Where do we slot it in? Probably this dashboard and also also from that, then where would it draw the price from the most up-to-date price?  Where do you where do you currently draw it from? Well, we have to go get quiet over time for everyone, those parts of water. Plus, if you order 10 Springs, you have to go get a new quote for it. Yeah. And have you got an agreed cost forever. Do you where do you get the quotes from?  Do you call the company? Or do you email them, or is it, is there a document or is it website? Because that price has changed depend on the quantities all the time because the price for 10 Springs, might be different for a price of 50. Would you just no moq set up?  Well, that would be difficult unless unless that data is available somewhere because what why Was essentially, if I could get rid of this, the time should be spent on cataloguing these products. So you have your moq your price, your your supply will be all set up and maintained and that is what then becomes the role of the person that is doing this.  Okay? Because at the moment, the only way that you could generate a purchase order is by looking at what the last price was that we paid. But that might be so far out of date and like not audited it since 2021. How would you say? The bit, you just thought about the person doing, if this is automated that's what if you had that now that would make this work much more efficient, wouldn't it?  So you almost do you almost want Wait until that information is available before you do the AI private. Yeah, because if you know, the mineral water countries, 10 and you all get into nine, then you need to order more. But if you don't know what the minimum water quantity is, hey, I can't tell you to order 10 more.  If you've got to lie. What I can tell you is all I can say, is that. In 10 weeks time, you're going to run out of these parts. You've only got nine left, you've got maybe ten weeks to go. You want one a week. So you're gonna run out in 10 weeks list, you can't say to you but the minimum water quantity is 10 or 20.  Therefore you need to order study. All you can do is tell you when you need to water, can't it? Yeah. Yeah, so we they're actually up front work needs to be obtaining that information and then inputting it somewhere in the system under that partner. Yeah so I mean you could do the first thing you do the first bit which is it's just as simple.  You're gonna run out of this party. Nine week's time. We know the lead times 10. So you need to order some. Yeah and then and then once you've got all the moq started out, you can say you're gonna run out in nine weeks time, the minimum water coach is 20.  Therefore you'll have enough now for 20 weeks, minus, whatever, and then and then you become more accurate and more user friendly. But you'd have to get that bit done up front. Or do this bit first and then do that bit after. If it makes it the way I know, is when do they need to water something?  Okay, so you're gonna run out and like in nine weeks times he order them. Now, you don't know the mineral water quantity, you just spend a lead time. So then the next video, they know what the minimum water quantities you have to order 20. If you now order them now and nine weeks time, they turn up, you've now got 20 rather than nine.  See, like about 11 more than you need. Yeah. How long does his 11 last for and then 11 last a week? 35, then a week 30 in week 25, you have to order. So, is that kind of order minimum, quantity order you? You can do once, you know, I think that, yeah, it's, it's do the first it and then, and then when that person's got that other dictator because that inner make it do both before he's gonna do that now, you'd set it up to move from one to another.  Yeah, do from the, this bit, the first, I think the first, the first thing is getting, that is a thing that data and storing it. The prices of this. Yeah, yeah, so that then the AI. To that then AI can read map to something because at the moment wouldn't it wouldn't you could map it to the last price paid but that will be inaccurate.  So the person's job then would be to make sure they keep a database at minimum and cost up to date. Or if you have websites that you regularly obtain pricing from, you could link the AI to email, you probably have to email them and ask what the course is going to be that specific day.  Yeah yeah it could still be very human automated email.  Be interesting. You could generate an email based on what you need to order. Send automatically, I can only have a pause for that corresponding product from the most recent email received from that whatever that product is Maybe the last quotation. Yeah, so once you've done it once the next time you do it'll be the same email address.  You just sent it to most of them have like um accounts payable or wherever they are sending email addresses for a company. It's not by person, it's by the department. So you don't have to worry too much about make it best the right person and business is to always just to one department.  Is it some way of just asking them to send you, like cannot just send this your Excel file with all your prices.  In which it changes by the day, but by the week or you know the price of steel goes up and you're making wishes out still, the pricing washer goes up. So every time you order it you have to go that's for another quote unless you order 10 million of them, store them all up.  There 10 pens each or you have to order a thousand every time this is the parts Market that variable. Yeah. Yeah, daily yeah, wow. Well, look at the price of Steel and energy go. Yeah, that's true. Because you're selling a product, not you've got a contractor, sell it. You can put the price up and down.  If you've got our contracts, you're going to supply with a million washes of 10 pencil washer it never changes, then if the price goes up and down, that's their problem. Not yours. You know, you're buying them individually. So the price will go up and down all the time. Yeah.  And because this is more bespoke and smaller scale, it doesn't make sense. Really to go for the contracts does it with. Well, that's one. If not done it in the past because it's a lot of work for, not a lot of games. Yeah. Um Yeah, they're pennies. But um, for someone like the larger Like, Castings and things like that.  So, so how give what's housing? Um, they're very expensive. So what we usually do is the price to agreed for 12 months so where there's a A higher value item. We grew up 12 months and then we do have a pricing agreement set on bonuses. Okay? As a contract.  With an expiry day. Um, and so you could look up to that, but that's not the case for every item, which is where the problem is. So if you got a quotation back, it's a second email saying it's got the minimum order, quantities, 10. You know, you're going to run out in, in nine weeks time, it can send an email to the Kermit supplier.  Yeah. And ask them to give you a quote. Yeah. What would happen when the quote comes back in? So then once the quote comes in the checks that are done is okay, what did we pay last time? Yeah. If the price is higher, we go back in question. Why?  Your price is higher? Um, but I typically tend to say like if it's within, you know, like 10, no, no, not that high. Um, like like three to four in line with CPI, really. Um, so inflation. Yeah. Um, Will let it go if it's above that. There needs to be a question.  Why? Um, is that human intervention? That part human intervention. So we're having to do the. So if we had a page store from the last slot you bought, yeah, I mean, the new purchase order for the new lot. That's someone takes you from the email sticks into a file.  AI should be able to check to see what's the difference in cost section. Yeah, I mean what I would prefer to do so before the PO is raised, um, that check is done because you don't want to raise. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you so the quote comes in from the customer.  You've got two quotes, the last one and the new one and then I could go. Well, last time was four pets. This one's our eight pets. Yeah. Then it could create a red flag that says, that's too high. Yeah, if it come in, at 4.5 Pence, then it's inside your CEO.  Your inflation, that it's okay, you can then rest the button to the next step which is then basic rotation. Yeah.  What happens if you do the quote and then A week goes by, and the prices have changed on all the stuff that's too late. Once you've got a quotation from a company, the price takes, because it is all right, it's only value for like things, right? Okay, and we are usually ordering within 24 hours, anyway, right?  To be a quick turn. And what you want to do is check it to make sure it's not higher than it should be and then start the process of raising the purchase oil for it. Are you have you got assistant for creating your pictures? Yeah. So then so then what we do is we go into partial entry.  Yeah. Let me go to test company. One sec.  As there's a lot of no hanging through, isn't it? Yeah, you can massively improve. The efficiency, can you?  Guys, there's gonna be such a step change in it if you don't get on this. I'm not I just it just seems like if there are other companies other parts of the world having these conversations. Now yeah, if you don't get on that, wow, our businesses Yeah, and the more other ideas and things come out of it.  It's just like wow how are we operating like this? Um, okay, so this is the bit that takes the time. So if I was to, for example, um generate this document and I was to go to all of the products that were needed from Auto sport bearings. Let me just take that off.  Come on.  And you could have, we could have all the software kind of in-house, can't we? That's kind of one of our USPS is everything's cloud-based now and it's like with company secrets and stuff. It's just, you can't get things very secure on the cloud where there's always risk there, isn't there?  I think for a contraction perspective, customers will be shying away from you if you're using the cloud. Yeah. For this sort of information. They want to see if you're storing the data. Yeah, you've been very responsible and all that. So when you say do you mean like on-prem server?  Do you just stored on Pratt. Yeah but then what about the cost for um The cost for an on-prem server. If they don't operate with on-prem, we could Outsource to envisage. Yeah. Creating a that part where we store our Centre, which is secure because we are a secure company as well.  Yeah, Oh yeah. You have to buy your own and have your own infrastructure in place but if you if you don't do it soon, I think uh everyone's gonna be doing it. So you kind of need him whether you like it or not, it's going to be kind of running because on-prem do you think I could use the cloud if you're okay with being, I think, I think if you went to Rolls-Royce to get up, making you a gearbox, but my date has totally went out.  I think they would probably will not like that. And most of the Cloud Solutions, um, tie-in with like cloud-based server. Do, you know who use standard measures, like encryption, um, things like that. You containerize everything. You have automated secret, updating key, updating and have that roll over. Which can all be automated and it can make the cloud very secure, but you can also do that with on-prem.  So that's like, you have everything on-prem. And you also have all these cyber security measures so it's like double double whammy double protection. It also means as well, a lot of companies have They're not so Keen to work with us-based cloud services in the UK. And a lot of it is Google Microsoft.  You know, we're wanting to go into using the account Council contracts and things like that banking and um, That's really why they're falling behind with AI integration is because everything is all the solutions available are us and it doesn't comply with gdpr and what is required. We've just done a huge like call of all on-prem based, um, applications and move them over to the cloud.  Um, and that was the direction that we were taking were sort of led to take from the I.T provider. Um, and then actually, you know, the conversation that we've had mainly around cost for cloud-based server now or does your and things like that. It's like the the day to day operating cost is like significantly more than what it would be to invest or you know, increase the memory for example and the current on-prem server and things like that.  It's it seems more expensive with Cloud. Yeah, if we was to use the cloud with this solution we're doing with envisage the minute, take Um, if we was use the cloud and, and the Cloud's GPU, Um, versus on-prem and buying like an expensive GPU. You actually recoup your cost in like four or five months if you're using the on-prem GPU with the big upfront cost because it's so expensive.  How much how much, um, Like, Space, is it? Utilising like the It's a minute taker that on the on-prem server like how much it's not, it's not it's much about space, it's it's the the GPU allows it to perform. Um, Faster. Yeah, so when you prompt it, yeah it it can quickly do the AI, right?  But you can figure it out quickly and get it straight back to you. So if you get like a top um like Nvidia a100 or something like that, it's with under 20 grand. But that's kind of it's, I think I think Carl said he could get it under 10, I got a number but yeah.  Oh yeah. How much, how long has it taken them to process those minutes from audio into Writing right? Yeah, we gained we had three different benchmarks. Anyways, so if you had like a standard laptop that was trying to do it, it was a 10 minute piece of audio was taking what an hour hours.  Yeah, it was, it was an hour or whatever. If you get an a100 GPU it can be done in less than a minute. Yeah. Um so yeah you take an hour-long record. Sorry. Um, or say 10 minutes long recording, I mean it doesn't necessarily matter that much. I mean, do you need immediate summary of your meetings?  Probably not, you know, you probably will leave that anything in an hour, it's done or whatever. But, um, it's better obviously to have it, have it quicker, especially if you're using like without a minute, take an integrated chat bar. So you can question the meeting. And you want to ask a question and have immediate response.  You don't want to kind of ask a question and sit around for a minute. There's also the factor as well of if you're trying to convince staff, this is the the way forward, this is the future having it as Snappy and as quick and as looking at really nice and sexy, you know, it's gonna bring people over and get people on board with this, with this wave, isn't it?  So I suppose that's another factor another value to consider the number one. Query companies would come back with is is it secure? Yeah. What's this AI? Who's what's it learning about me and whatever? And so I think I think Most companies will end up coming back local for their every single, like when we've done our uh, you know, business kind of case and and looking at our business versus, what else is out there and specifically this minute taker versus whatever's out out there already The constant thing that's coming back is everything else is cloud-based and you know, it's easier, it's scalable.  It's it, you know, there's so many Pro Pros to Cloud but you lock yourself up from so many Industries and if we're providing Cloud solutions to our clients that locks them off from Industries as well and potential clients. So it is, you know, there's still value in having on-prem isn't there?  I think, I think it's got to be that way. I think from from an automotive perspective for us the way we operate as a business, all the things we do in confidential Showcase showcarts and stuff. You'll have to, I think the customers all demand it, you can say, super duper yes, secure, they're probably good.  Demand to be in a certain server, okay? Um, So we've thrown it all away. So then what we do is we pop the supplier in? Yeah. Let's say Auto Sport bearings. You then press stopped code, you put in your Warehouse for every single part Then you would put in, let's just say this was a part shortage, so 104 2262.  Three, four, two, two, six. Two, Okay. Then you put in the quantity that you need. Let's say it's five. Then you put in your day. Which might be the 10th, the fifth. I don't know if that's a weekend. I think it is. Let's cut the 17, the 15th September.  You can see how long it's taking me just. Yeah, cost. Okay. Then I'd look at the quote. Okay, 6.70. That's what we've agreed. Enter. Okay. Then I go up another line, another line, another line. My God. So, if you're ordering 50 parts in that company, it's 50 lines. But yeah, Bearing in mind.  So, this one supplier has got  144 well 142 parts. Somebody would be that half day in putting that data. You could just use an AI agent. And get it to all for you. Yeah, that's what we're here for. Yeah. The next problem with that is you raise the purchase order. That is the invoice that comes in, isn't it?  Yeah, so then what we do and this is the bit that I hate is end purchase order. Preview.  I refuse to raise orders anymore. I'm like you can do it. I'm not doing it. I've seen right now. Yeah. It's slow, isn't it? What they're called again. This one CIS Pro. This is CIS, Pro's. Actual? Yeah, this is Francisco. See other things? Yes they're all like this they no matter what company you're in, what system really.  So then this is how it it generates a document. Got quantity part number. Everything I've inputted. And it's got all of our T's and C's. Okay, then you generate that to email, send it to myself. Because it doesn't send automatically outward system.  As matter where you are. It's always like this everywhere. The same process. Is it like this? Yeah. To purchase all the processes mean there's absolute painful. The worst bit there is Mexico, this is the easy. This is a relatively easy bit. Then you have to forward this, then to the supplier, but somebody could come over to me and be like Leah, oh, project blah, blah, blah.  Have you ordered the material? And what about this? And what about that? And then next thing is, I've already opened that email and I forgot to send the PO and then two weeks later cuz this has happened in the past. I've gone, why, why they not got that Pa?  Oh well it was never sent. Yeah, so then you're like, you're late on delivery. I should just do what I said. It go from them in, in my previous company, the way that it worked was. So there's there was um, requisition. So that's the request. Essentially, now we have repositions from the shop floor but we don't have any requisitions for MRP driven demand because essentially the approval is MRP saying you need it.  Well, I don't agree with that, to be honest with you, Um, because of the thinking that we do in between, you know, MRP and the PO Um, So a requisition would be raised that would then go for sign off, then that would go through to purchasing purchasing would raise the PO.  The PO would then go for sign off because at with approved hierarchical level. So um it could be over 10,000. It goes be approved. Yes. Yeah, but we did used to work on like government contracts and things like that. Um, and also our head officers in Singapore so they were a bit more.  Um like there was more type of controls in place but we probably wouldn't need that here, the requisition approval. Um, If it was like an MRP driven requirement, but then even now you've just seen, I've raised that PO and it's gone for no approval. Okay, you can send it out to customers, I'll just send that out to the supplier straight away.  And even my teammate, there was one time again, relying on a human to remember, I was like, why enough? We got 25 000 pounds worth of spend coming in with one supplier within one month. And then, I was like this wasn't second for approval, and it's like, oh, I forgot to send it, right?  Okay, so this isn't supposed to go straight to the client. You're relying on a human to remember Studio things. No, it should be. It should be automated through the system. Yeah. And if it can't if it can't be automated for your system which is what I've always been told.  Then we need something that's automated so that if it's over a certain threshold, It gets sent to an approving user. Yeah. Yeah. If it's a significant amount. Yeah. Which it's a simple. Binary automation, I suppose is in there depending on Anything over like what should we say? Like 10 grand or?  Yeah, we've got, we have got levels that we should adhere to which I could send over to you. Um, but essentially, yeah, it's a risk, another risk in the business. And now, I ask the next part, where you get the invoice to relate to the purchase order. Yeah. Do you have problems with that as well?  We do so, um, Obviously, I mentioned that in my last year. Um, I've got the accounts lady from upstairs to join this meeting. Um, Should I should I get it to come down that because then we can do that back end bit? Yes. Yeah, I'm gonna go toilet. Oh, you go first.  I'll go to the one upstairs.  Did you guys bring lunch with you? Or are you do you know for lunch second? Sorry. Did you bring lunch with you? No, no I didn't bring anything. No, no. Is there somewhere nearby? Um yeah, I was going to say there's um, either Sorry McDonald's. No, they're staying McDonald's.  There's there's a Subway, there's Greg's. Um, sort of like up the road, there's a little cafe that does like baguettes and things like that. Um, There's a culp and stuff, as well, like sort of five minutes down the road, probably go to the cafe. Are you tired? Yeah, well, I had to get it, but, whatever.  It was quarter five. I wasn't into to go to, yeah, because this is a traffic tour over to Birmingham. But it wasn't too bad actually, but there then picked out the strip and then Yeah, have you noticed me yawning? No, I just wanted because you said you had to drive that and then drive to Birmingham and then drive from there and then over to uh, Craig and then Craig's brought us down.  Yeah, yeah, it's the, it's the drive back that Oh, this is terrific and I don't even live that far from Birmingham. But once you're in and it's getting close to, oh, once after about 2. 30. You can just forget about it until past seven. Like that Gap is just such a bit of Birming, just in just anywhere anywhere around Birmingham the M, the M6 is horrific, but Yeah.  If you if you're just driving around the the general Centre and just over to live in Wolverhampton so I'm a living degree. Oh dear. Yeah, I've seen agree. Then I assume about the traffic, it's painful. Manga, so you go back there tonight. Dear yeah. That's quite dry, Dan, isn't it?  You know every every day. No, I work from the the other office. Oh, I'm gonna be saying, yeah, This is a trip down. A nice little trip for you today. Oh, the traffic was over at that Junction. Isn't about Vista where it goes. That take to turn off to.  Yeah. Got two days, haven't you? Yeah, the right side. Lane goes on the boat up from up onto. Uh, it was slow. Today. I used to go to India a lot, right? And we used to leave on a catch a flight of like nine o'clock at night. So you go to Heathrow fight and you're all sitting in a bus called taxi going.  Please be like, please be late, because you don't want to go to India, right? So if I miss the fight, this is great. That's right. Every single time for 20 times, I drove down the M40 at five o'clock. It was completely clear and the M25, we used to get to the airport terminal because they can't.  Where's all the traffic? Yeah. Are you going to Holiday on a Saturday to get to the airport and there's a massive car crash, or something like that. Why did this never happen? When they stick out to India? Which part of India, did you guys? Let's go to Puna. Fight him on buying and drive to Puna.  I thought. Mumbai tapuna must be like must be like hundreds of miles away. It's 80 miles used to take us three hours. Really? Wow. I thought I looked on the backers is that is that Mumbai and Pena, they're like, they're like that. It's like really. Um, traffic was crazy.  You always hear about trying to get out of Mumbai to say, like an hour hour and a half sometimes then you drive up the motorway and then you're going to live over the hills up into Puna. It was just crazy and the horns. Oh, yeah. Everyone's people the horn.  Um, Button in the middle Lane. It's just cows walking across the lake. Yeah. So if I go get some more water I'll quickly run up and grab your son. Okay, cool, cool. Oh, great to work it's just like Which is quite hard in 10 days out there but yeah I saw a video on on the internet of these kids.  This guy who's gone out there to, I don't know. See that seems India and he's just filming himself walking down the street and he's just like I'm completely just like you can hear the back, just the the horns blow and he's like It's killed me. It's just like it's a massive.  Yes, I mean it's like sensory. Just yeah, overlay overlay. It's crazy. They never stop it. Never, it's never quite no. It's an amazing place. Yeah, but it gets so hot this time of year. Now, I'm gonna go just after Easter. Oh man, it was just absolutely baking coming out the door, instantly straight away, it's like, wow.  And then about some about 10 weeks, Larry chucked up, right continuously. Monsoon time that just gets mental, because everything's flooded, everyone's getting electrocute because they steal electricity from lights and stuff. And they do it get electrocuted because of the water. Have you seen some of the litter? That honestly, some of the bridges literal, photographs of rivers.  And it's just litter. The whole river, you wouldn't even think it's because so, high water goes over the trees. As the water subsides. The trees are completely covered in litter where it all gets caught in their leaves and stuff as it go Christmas decors. This River and looking down.  You know, you see those pictures of those like um where they take a bow, just round it onto the beach, then they strip it out. They was like, it's section and like a square. And by the side of this River, it's about five or six boats. All speed stripped down all the pushes going out.  Oh God, it's crazy. It is Mumbai and Delhi is like crazy. Yeah, I watch my my um, like my Instagram, you know, you look at whatever. Mine is just, it's like well, it's got a bit better now. But for a short period of white, 90 of it was Indians making street food.  Yeah. What are they doing? There's rats crawling through their fingers and they're just like he's stretching out the man with his feet's really not. I mean, yeah, we, yeah, it was really good. I mean, the food is just completely different to why why you experience here in the UK.  It's just As A. Crazy place to go to. Yeah, the job was being 10 days away from your family. He was quite a long time and you can't get to the airport and then to the hotel and in the in that hotel was the people who are leaving to go home that day.  So you get out of your minibus 10 days to go, right? They did, they're just leaving and it's like resolved, let's try it. When you see them, leave the very good thing is, you know, in 10 days time, it'd be other way around and you'll be leaving someone else.  I would, I went 10 times or 11 times in one year. You have a supplier out in India. No, no. It's been working for Titan Motors. Oh, right. So we were doing a whole platform strategy for them. So we spent a lot of time engineering stuff and going back and forth, it was really good.  I mean, it's a great experience to do. It's just it's incredibly hot and uh, and 10 days away from your family is quite tough. Yeah, I kind of feel that bit when you've done it a couple of times. But yeah, that's good. Were you doing when you would Tessa was  Oh today. Yeah. And they made a car that yes, yes, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Were you involved in the city that was way before I was there. That was like, 2,000? Of course it was. Yeah. 2010 or so. Such a crazy place to never stop. Tell me the most surreal things I had was in the, in the it was Christmas, time in the reception of the hotels.  I was leaving at nine o'clock at my house, whatever it was. It was Christmas carols going on with the Christmas tree and kids, all dressed up singing Christmas carols and you walk out and it's like, baby and like mentors are completely different, you know, from one to the other.  Yeah, Christmas trees and carols one minute, and walk out the door, and it's just absolute Madness. Yeah. Well, what's good? If you get a chance to go, there's some really some most people have places in the world or India, isn't it? It's just those cities that I don't think.  I don't want to go. No. Yeah, the pollution like the air pollution. It's quite. Yeah. It's grey, isn't it the whole time? Let's put that going to go up for Christmas one. Yeah. But I'm sure I think it's better more. More better places that I could go? Less traffic.  Yeah, yeah. Feel somewhere quiet? Yeah, yeah. At Thailand. Yeah. Thailand. I lived in Thailand for six months. Oh really, I was teaching English there and yeah, teaching English. Yeah. I honestly, I think how am I qualified, you know, do you know because when when it's your native language and they're asking you like all about imperfect tense and condition, I'm like, any of this.  And what I can quickly do, she's, they've just got clothes off Monday, so she's really busy. Um, Basically, what happens is we'll get the invoice in. Yep. And essentially, there'll be a check, done to see whether or not that matches, it'll be put onto the system, then there'll be a check down to see whether or not it matches the manual chair.  Yeah. Yeah. The quantity and the, um, the value that's on the purchase order. If, if it if there isn't if it doesn't match, then it goes into something called a registered report, it goes as a registered invoice, which is a manual report, which I will show you.  Which we save in teams. Just another different sister. Yeah, RF used to use, teach people gives enemy teams but I've got emails that keeps enemy team message from Oh, see. We are just send me a teams because it's quicker. We have people that refuse though, to send email all these teams.  Oh, right. I mean, I do. I'm I just don't have to think about. You send me out of one or the other. So keep sending me both in this. Oh, yeah. Okay, so this is what is then generated? So, these are all the invoices that haven't matched. So, They check that the grn that we have matches.  So that's when we receive something in, if something isn't receded, then it goes on here as no. Grm So then we have to go and find out whether or not the part's actually been received and if it's been received, then we have to a good receipt it in. Why would it not be?  Why would that not be the case? Why not be the GRN? Um, so there are a few instances. Um, we sometimes get Parcels delivered to this front desk, which is unmanned. Yes. Um, we are trying to put controls in place, so that happens. It has been happening, less.  Part may have gone to seldom. Yeah, and they don't look anything in, right. So, but they also don't have to know that things have arrived. Um, not Andrew. Um, So, And then you get the invoice up. You get the invoice from the com, the supply flyer. But you don't actually know you've had the parts.  They could be delivered to the back. Right at the back. Um so then yeah, we just need to make sure that um Basically, that that's booked in and then what they'll do is they'll match the purchase order. I'm sorry if your invoice to the grn. So, if the value doesn't match or the quantity doesn't match, that's been receded.  So for example, stores may only receive four berries, we've been invoiced for six. It will go on this report because it doesn't match. Yeah. But that physical check is done by human. Surely AI. Can just do that check. Yeah. And then create this report. Anesthegia as the invoice. Got the personal number.  Yes. So legal requirement, you ask, sorry. You asked us. We, we do ask that as a requirement. Yes. And Sometimes it won't. So for example could you do a match by part number then or something maybe or it should be? It should be by PO number. Yeah. And I what I'm trying to tell the staff up like the sorry the accounts team is if it doesn't have a PO reject it, no PO no pay, absolutely get rid of it, send it back and then they should contact purchasing or whoever their contact is here and what is the PO number and then resubmit it with the PO.  That's the, that's the supply I should do that. That's the supplier should do that because they're just selling it too. Because I don't know what they said. Just yeah. But also, but also at the same instance, it's like, well then how do we know that it's been agreed because you've just sent us an invoice?  Yeah. Um, So, that's the process that we go through. So even though it's Doesn't seem like much of a process. It's very time consuming, you know, we're probably making Well over 10 000 purchases a year like well over that So do you do you want to speed up the ones that are correct to give you more time to the ones that aren't correct?  Or would you want to do? Do you want to speed up the ones that aren't correct? I think both. So if it matches great, it can be paid. Post it off, it goes, if it can't be, I don't want somebody spending all the time, telling me what the problem is telling me that it doesn't match and creating this report can AI.  Tell me what the problem is. Could it tell me price difference, quantity difference? Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Just flag it and give a reason why. Yeah because again it's the similar thing it's going to be looking for certain things and to match. So the intervention prize first, we're going to go find a purchase order.  Then you've got to find out the system and you've got one open there and one open now. That's got six. That's got seven. Whereas surely that says six and that says seven is. Yeah, isn't it? Yeah. Take away the person's checking. Yeah. Because then that immediately frees up her tie, you know, and then can that report just be sent out by email sent to purchasing purchasing then have to go and do the Amendments or do the checks, which is a normal publishing function.  Um, So you wouldn't want a document like this with all of these different you could you can yeah this document works perfectly fine. But like I say she's generating this just by inputting all of this information. Yeah onto the sheet but all of it manually. Yeah. Where you can see from the comments.  That's not computer generation. Yeah. I thought this was computer General, right? This is all the manual. Yeah. Wow. But is it, is it necessary? Yeah, so he's saying what time period is this over this document? Does she create a new one, every month or something like that? No weekly.  Oh, so it's a weekly document. It's a brand new one every week. Okay. Is it necessary to have that or could you just have like Um, Based on the number of discrepancies, I would say weekly is required, which is essentially what you want. By the end of your end of the month.  You would like to have all of invoices that have been received in that month to be tied up and so you can then recognise the the cost within the month rather than it carried over to So we're doing I'll roll up as fast when you schedule to the end of month.  Now we're doing our end of month for last month. Yeah so there's only six days into 16 into May. It's still trying to work out. All of April's costs. Yeah well he really was on April 29th to know the costs. Yeah for that month. Yeah. Because every every as long longer, it takes you to do it.  The further you are away, then you're in the next button now suddenly you're doing amazings. Instead of Aprils, no one ever gets a proper visualisation of how much you spent or or how much you are. That's the word you owe or you've got to pay out. So you only do it monthly then?  No no. The the document should be done weekly every month. You have a roller you say like this month. Yeah, we charge 600 pounds, we've got 400 pounds back. So with Nike 200 returns of pounds in the deficit, right? Yeah. So but you can never see it until it's already dead.  Six day, six into the month. We still didn't know what happened in April because of all this, this part here, this roll-up stuff. Whereas you probably have a lot of things were automated. Yeah. Yeah. Because then you spend more time, sorting them out rather than just typing in the rotation system.  The part number, the name of the costs and what you'll probably find is that in a lot of organisations Finance would probably be a good one to hit, because I mean, the amount of mundane tasks in. How do you do it, you know. And, and to be able to then give figures to, you know, of like profit or loss at the end of the month, like, six days in, and we're still not able to give an accurate figure to here.  You know, our parent company or sorry major shareholder, you know they they've given us a Target that they want the month closed out within five days. Today's the deadline. So, the idea, I guess would probably be like a dashboard that has all of the information and all the separate areas of the dashboard are linked to areas where they'll get the information from and it's live updated every second.  Yeah, that can't be not quite weekly. It's only weekly because she's got a typing by hand, isn't it? It could be hourly. Yeah. Yeah.  I guess what it would be looking at is like, what would its trigger be? So at the moment, the invoices are emailed across. Yeah, to your customers to accounts team then from there, which already posted the rest, because if they, again open an email or file it away and they haven't actually actioned it then invoices can go missing.  Okay, Um, but from there then how They then obviously add that to the system, upload it to the system. What would AI be looking at? Would it be looking at the email? Would it be looking at the system in like where the voice up from? Well, the system? Yeah.  And Unless you wanted it to be scanning emails for invoices, but then everybody's emails will be constantly, they only go to accounts payable. So when you want to invoice a company, you don't send it to Bob. You should send it to accounts payables. Oh, is that right? Okay. It comes into one, one, one domain.  So it's always the same place. So you'll get an email with an invoice attached to it. Probably be texting. It just be here as an invoice. So then all you got to do is That's something enough to download that for you. What can it do? It automatically? Because then you're saying, people forget to download to download it.  Yeah. So since it comes in it automatically gets put into it. It is possible to to get it to download it. Yeah. And then repeat and then read it. Yeah. And then upload it to you because then that would be by the out by the minute, but a second, wouldn't it?  It would be every time an order comes in for an email, from some other invoice. He's automatically have that process in place. If you download it, check it, review it for the problems on there. And when you do have that bit of back and forth with the purchase order, if there's some dispute or just some negotiation, I guess, You could because the number's going to be the same on the purchase order, isn't it?  So when a new email comes in or new email comes in, the latest one is used and that is replacing anything old, or whatever. And I mean, the fact that you were forcing to make sure they have the invoice number on the yeah, on the sorry, the personal number on the invoice.  Yeah. Ever a load space. I've been that doesn't happen that we're just making difficulties. It does make it hard. Yeah. So you could have a reference. I mean, you could have a chequer within the email and now it bounced straight back. If it's not there. Yeah. I mean, invoice comes in.  I checked it. Missing the PO number requesting, an invoice of the PR. Um yeah. Yeah. Because the one thing that bugs me is my pain for this report like no piano push it back then. Yeah, yeah. Because then it doesn't go up then it doesn't go on there on the list.  He doesn't know and you won't get charged either, until they actually get it in if they, if they missed the end of the month again, it's 30 days again, actually can help you with your cash as well. Yeah. Because I just keep pushing the back and then drill probably.  Yeah. And with it being automatic, they probably just sent it looked away. Look back. And you've got an email, yeah, as well, because a lot of people invoice at the end. Yeah. Um, they want to get their invoices in so that then they recognise the revenue. Yeah. So yeah, that's sort of that is the process.  Um, obviously, yeah, it takes a lot. Um, A lot of it's done through sis, bro. And I would have to get the right people to show you what they go through in the system. Yeah. Um but I think you know, there those are some of the main key areas and um, What I'd like to do is take this away like when we when we wrap up take it away with these main say like five areas that we've highlighted, take it back to the scene management team.  Highlight that this is what we've been through. Um, these are the key areas that we've identified um, And then, you know what this, I guess the solution is, you know, what? What would your, what would you put forward as the solution? Um, and then we, yeah, we sort of run through it like that, really?  Yeah, the, the things I guess that you'd get the highest return of investment for, isn't it? The biggest pain point. Well, I mean that's where you kind of say to them currently. It takes two weeks to get a quote, a contract thing done and we can hopefully get that down to a day.  Providing that someone is being proactive with checking things or whatever. How much time how much money would that save? Yeah, things like that. Well yeah. Not only that it's like not money. That it would save but you know how much revenue you could generate? Yes, things like that. I mean lost opportunity.  You know. Could we have won that project? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  And I suppose, we could do this two ways. So we could say you identify your biggest pain points and then get them over to us or send us over all your pain points. We come up with a certification I think so because right whereas actually you know some of some of the things that I've mentioned here immediately, I know that that's where our pain like pain points are at the moment and actually, you know, probably quite detrimental for the business.  Yes. Um, you know, some of the more admin inside tasks, that I've just mentioned sort of within purchasing and within Finance. That would be Like it. Yeah, like an actual physical cost saving I believe, you know, like a um, Time saving um to then free, those people up to work on added value activity.  But the things that we've mentioned here are actually so critical to the business from a risk perspective and also Revenue generation perspective. That to be honest with you, I think they would probably come first above everything, but that's what I'd like to speak to the team about and make sure that we get that priority order straight.  Um then come back to you with what that looks like, and then obviously review what your solution or your proposal would be? Yeah. That sounds good to us. Yeah, yeah. Microsoft, you just use Microsoft Outlook or whatever. And do you have uh, office Enterprise? Yeah, Enterprise The part of that office 365 office 365.  Enterprise is it I don't know. Isn't that one of the subscription? It might. I think it used to be that the old office. Yeah, I don't know. Right. I think, you know. Was that an add-on? No, probably not. We take away. No Microsoft. I just I've got here, so I've got make to print.  Quote, generator a quote generator. Yeah. Quote Chequer, which is your contract review. Yeah. Purchase order process per se. Yeah. Then invoicing. Yeah.  So what I'll do is I'll send a summary of what we've sort of just sort of. See it be interesting to see. Yeah yeah that'd be cool. Yeah. Um, And then, just some of the key areas that we've spoken about into under those sort of key projects, Um, and then once I've had a chat with the smt, I think I've got a meeting with them.  Well, we had a meeting this morning so It might be a might be another catch-up tomorrow. Um, These Tuesday's Day, isn't it? Yeah, I'm not sure it'll be this week at some point. Um, and then I can come back to you with with what we want to do moving forward.  Okay, perfect. Yeah. Yeah. It's really interesting, isn't it? Yeah, it seems like I was getting excited, it excites me but at the same time it makes me nervous because I think Like, there's so many things that you can use for it, like, use it on, or that you could Implement it on.  And it's like, where do you, where's the best place? That's why I think finding the most valuable things. Yeah, the most valuable thing. And even even if we were to, you know, the first point I guess would be actually Like having some tangible data to be able to work with to then evidence the return on investment.  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Um, exactly. But it does make me nervous because I think, oh gosh, you know, especially from my perspective like, yes, I can help Implement these things and I can help Drive some of them through. But they're not my departments. You know. It's it's there. Those departments that need to be working on their own.  Yeah. Like um, like transformative sort of, why aren't they doing? It's just because they're too busy or Don't think if I look at what we've the people that we have in those teams at the moment, I wouldn't say that they are necessarily I don't feel like they have that type of mindset at the moment.  They're very much in the day-to-day and that won't change in the short term. Um, Because they are the people that are doing. No, it's easier for me because I have a team that I can I don't I'm not involved in the day-to-day. So it's easy for me to then work on the some of these longer term strategies and things.  But the people that are doing the day-to-day, you know, without them, it can stop. So it's important that they still they still do that but I just want to make sure that I get it right for what they do because I don't do what they do every day. So, I've already spoken to, To one of the guys.  Uh, you know, like you said as well, um, Once there is some value that's been seen with the solution that we Implement initially and you're able to show that to other departments or whatever other departments are seeing that it might, you know, get the ball rolling a bit more as well and allow a wider transformation to occur.  Yeah, yeah, definitely got maybe a bit of a cultural change. Yeah, yeah. Everyone's like this, this has improved the time. This has made life easier. We want this. Now, you know, good looking at the low-hanging fruit sort of long term. I, in terms of the way we design gearboxes at the moment, we sort of design and put them out the door and then forget about them in a way.  And I'd like to get really more sort of data driven in terms of We use the pro, the data we're using for making it and also capturing data hopefully within the field about what it's doing. We don't really understand our product enough, I think, especially for very specific, bespoke like Aerospace applications.  Ideally you don't want to just ship it out, you want to know what it's doing. And be able to understand when it might fail or issues that arise during So it's so are there some sort of sensors on there that you can at the moment? No, but I think that's where we should be heading.  Is having a sort of They call it these other condition monitoring or a digital twin. Essentially having something that's capturing data and sending it back to you. I think that's something we should look at in terms of The sort of products that we offer, especially for Niche. High value being quite Aerospace.  It's not that you don't, you just don't want it to fail. Yeah. But you could even potentially even Warning them. You know, if it looks like something's happening. So you can monitor sort of like accelerations of gearbox for seeing different points and that can tell you that it could be failing, this certain part could be failing and if you collect enough data from things like that, you could create an AI model that can tell you the perfect solution.  Yeah. The perfect design. Yeah, you could really This data-driven decision making, which is, you know, a core tenant of AI, isn't it? Essentially, any sort of linking we obviously, we build the gearboxes, we measure certain parameters, so, bits and dimensions. And if you could link those Dimensions to what you're seeing in the field, I know you've got maybe identify failures or potential failures.  Yeah, so it's studied down the road but it's sort of yeah where I'd like to sort of get to just be more data driven. Yeah. And actually use the data because We generate a lot of data, we don't really use it. Yes yeah yeah because is that because you've got so much data it's really hard to pick out the patterns inside it.  Or the other relevance of the data you've got loads and loads of database, really hard and so much, you can't really delegate it. We had a transmission on test and it's generating thousands of lines of data. So it's recording every day. Thousands of a second. You know, what, accelerations and everything did it run for 50 hours?  Right? So there's a huge amount of data just there. Yeah. Well, that's stored. Isn't the cloud? Is it? I think he's likely on the surface. Okay. Yeah, it's a huge amount of data. Does it automatically delete after a certain amount of time, or do you have the storage? So you're measuring accelerations inside.  The gearbox putting accelerometer on the case on the outside of the casing? Yeah. And if you you can look at that acceleration. So in terms of just the signal, yes, the brms of that signal and that can tell you if that RS is changing over time. Yeah. But maybe something's happening and it's advocating.  Yeah. And if you if you look at the specific points in of that acceleration Trace and do a four-year transfer to identify certain frequencies in the Spectrum. Yeah that could tell you perhaps a certain points fail so we had one where The the response this frequency response was changing over time.  And we can pinpoint to a bearing failure. Yeah. But all that was Taking snapshots of data analysing it you know by by hand always take another hour. Yeah, what it's doing there and ideally you'd want to try and automate all that and say have something they could say the OMS is changing over time.  The, the frequency response is showing this frequency is being excited. Yeah. And it wasn't before. Yeah, how do you picking up frequencies? Not audio. Was it audio? No, no, it's from the acceleration data. You do it from your transform, it pixel. So it turns the your acceleration data which is a series of sine waves, right?  It just splits out those sine ways into frequency, inter frequencies. Yeah. Okay. Don't show you guys, you can't enter it, is that you say your age can only do an hour at a time? Yeah, they're trying to tell you, whereas from an AI perspective interrogating, 50 hours of the data shouldn't take a long time, should he should be picking out those those, uh, those patterns inside?  It can tell you what's anomalous? Yeah. Yeah, essentially, yeah, looking for something is different. Yeah, they shouldn't be there, and then try and understand why why it's there. Yeah, so if you tested 20, gearboxes and one had it. Yeah. Yeah. What do we know about when it was built possibly?  Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, this is sort of where I'd like to get to but I think there's all these sort of individual activities are Hopefully building up our capability and also saving time that we can spend time doing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's experience. It doesn't say. I mean, it doesn't sound.  Too difficult, really? If you've got, if you've already got the system for doing that, for kind of looking at the data or storing the data, then we create something to just analyse it, you know. Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's just even a dashboard with a visualisations who could just be an easy way to You know, know what's going on and understand it.  Isn't it really? Yeah. Yeah. Go. I found a bit exhausted. Now. Yeah, I think definitely opened my eyes to, you know, sort of listening to you talk and understanding the actual possibilities. I think, I think that I didn't truly understand that before today, Um, you know I've only ever really just touched the surface and I can really understand that our fear is that we're not going deep enough fast enough.  So we we constantly kind of thinking are we? Are we just playing just playing at this? Yeah. Are we really getting into what I can really do? So I think there's some stuff we don't even know it can do no thought of yeah than it can do and we're just sinking.  Should we go? Should we try and go deeper whatever? I think the thing is with me is that I like I can I often have like, sort of quite, um, Like big ideas and then I'm like, oh no, no, yeah too much but it won't work, you know? And then and then I it I kind of forget about I move on to the next thing and it's like how do I now capture those ideas and make sure that they're not forgotten about?  Yes. Okay. It might be a bit too big to be able to handle and sort of, um, sort of, you know. Um, Like achieve now. Um, but What can we do? Yeah maybe a year down the line. Yeah once we've actually understood a case sort of these lower hanging fruits.  Yeah like then how far can we take it as big as you say that you want to keep? I mean that Vision you've got? Yeah for bigger stuff. If you if you keep that in mind where you're doing the smaller stuff you want to make sure that's feeds integrated into it.  Yeah, go make all your uh train lines, uh wide gauge and then have to change them all to navigation in the future and then your bridges are too small other so we we're finger as well. How can you what's this going to end up looking like future and try to make sure that what you make is scalable up.  Yeah, fits into that Vision? Yeah. It's but in that's quite hard when you don't. Yeah, that's what be the Visionary is exactly. But um, no, it's been really inside. Yeah, we know that all the solutions are made by us. We, you know, we have the capability to integrate them, you can't integrate teams with uh sis pro with, you know, separate software separates.  Where because those companies aren't talking to each other in the way that you need them to, isn't it? So yeah. Yeah. Okay. Wow. Yeah, perfect. So is there anything that you That you are working on that. We potentially haven't mentioned. Obviously, it's quite specific for the beach business, isn't it?  No, I think we're we're looking at the same stuff. Almost identical teams are taking away the mundane tasks to give you more time to be Innovative. Yeah. And or to increase productivity. Yeah. And so that's what that's is a quote, quote thing. We're looking at doing the minute take we're doing, you know, purchase orders.  Even I know you said about people I have to raise a wreck on paper. Oh wow. When I go into the office to get the paper from the post department, I asked for a time machine, I'll go back to 1975. Yeah. Just come back to Angelifier and we are so we have to still do the same thing and it's just ridiculous, but it should all be done.  And then the whole is the invoice comes in as they've been done. Why why is why is it on paper out of Interest? I don't because it's always been on paper. Oh, Book as well. So you have to put a piece of car behind it, right at it. So you take the top off and they keep the second one.  It's a carbon copy version of it. Oh I don't even know what are you doing, Moscow? SOS. Yeah. What type of like products are they purchasing, is it? So so yeah the story doing uh at the moment we're doing one project which is a restim or for an XJC and I've had to buy last week.  All I wanted to do was spot a gearbox. And no, it was a fuel tank. A heating a HVAC. Oh yeah. And the platform I went through, I had to write this opinion. A piece of paper, give it to them and push it. Then he had to get right in the name on the, on the quotation, the name was wrong, then the cost is wrong.  Then what order is it? It took me like three days to get them to pay the guy. So it was like 700 pounds, probably cost 2 000 pounds, just the process. It's just that's the way it's always been. It's always a new system coming in at some point in the future, another material realises and then when you replace doesn't work either that.  Well anyway, so we have the same problem with us is much lower. We don't buy as much stuff as you do but we have the same issue with purchasing. So yeah, yeah, crazy matching invoices to purchase orders. Have it got the invoice number and the baseball number right? Is there a delivery note?  Yeah. Interesting. And that's because it takes up so much time in people's lives. Are you just wasting? Yeah. I think we did like 400 quotes last year. So every one of those quotations has gone for that documenting paperwork there, it's just ridiculous amount of time and effort, it takes today.  That's a good way of looking at it as well, isn't it? The amount of time to start right in your proposal? Yeah. Oh yeah. And then the amount of time and we're going to try quantifying now qualifying them. Now when they come in so it's like a really ridiculous.  One as much as taking the Nick for a benchmark quote. We're trying not to do those ones. Yeah. But it's really hard because you can never be sure for customers going to really gonna bite for it. So you've got to give everyone the same amount of you know, importance when you're writing them and it just takes so much time together.  Hey, I want like I say three or five, two jobs for me two days. Tops, one minute. That's crazy. Yeah, amazing. Yeah. Okay, fantastic. Well, I think I mean, I put this meeting in two half, three but um, I'm happy to wrap up. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's been yeah, really interesting.  Um, I think that's some good points here to take away. Um, I think I'd be really interested to see what minutes have driven out. Yeah. Do you mind sharing them? Yeah, of course. Um, and then I will have the conversation that I need to have, and then I'll be back in touch with you guys and then we can move forward from there and we'll see.  Yeah, each each area. We'll need representation from the relevant. People that undertake the tasks? Yeah. Yeah. Um, but I think we've got some points to start with I hope we've shown you that it is possible to improve absolutely with AI or whatever you go for what you're doing in the future.  Yeah. Do you think so if you send over the the pain points, um, after discussing with the team and everything, and then from those pain points, we can send you over maybe proposals for each and yeah. And see which one you want to go forward? We'll start with that highest priority one.  Yeah. And then um, yeah. So identify what that looks like, moving forward. Um costs time scale and things such a very interesting stuff really because it's exactly what we're looking to do. Increase productivity. Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you. It's been lovely. It's really, really been lovely.  It's really good, actually, because everybody who's spoken to I'm going to speak to a couple of companies have the same level of excitement. Yes. Yeah to find someone who's going over here. So no, it's not that interesting. Well I think if you get that you're not talking to the right people.  Yeah, absolutely. You're the right people? Yeah. And it's it's a universal languages if I as human beings, we want to do the things without not processing. Not yeah. Sold training. Yeah. Are you talking to, um, sort of like more senior team members or more sort of middle management or Junior members?  Or we've, uh, some, we've spoken to computers analysis, uh, for us. Uh, they were really interested in the chat box stuff, they've got loads of data, they don't have to find and that was quite interesting because they already kind of use AI topology and topography. So that was great.  Yeah. That was just like the direction with engineering and then um, we've spoken to a company owners or County directors about it now, so it's kind of like a mixture. The most interesting ones are kind of A bit lower down. Also our level sort of thing whereas there's that interaction you can have with them yeah cuz yeah.  They're all interested at higher up but they don't really understand their random position to this sort of level of conversation now. It's really interesting interactive and it's really quite you can watch some really good ideas. Yeah, because they're actually going through the pain points. So yeah. Yeah, so you're talking.  Yeah, and whereas life, I speak to my boss about it. It's all, yeah, it's all great. But he, you know, he really used to be in this sort of routine a CD energy and his users that goes with it because that's what's going to also drive on as well as Adam and stuff.  And so yeah, it's a combination of people, um, Yeah, it's just interesting but we were talking to innovate UK. How do you not have? Um, like kind of uh, coffee mornings where you get people like like-minded individuals to talk about a subject and they were like, oh no. So we are almost going to start.  Trying to find your core of PJ. Yeah. That maybe once a month, you have a half a day coffee, ketchup. Yeah. When you're sitting a nice and Innovative environment and just talk about a subject and you try and come up with ideas to help. Companies individually. Yeah they matches the spot for a few ideas.  That maybe that's. The thing is even like sharing just sharing the ideas. Yeah, you take one thing back in it. Yeah. Contact with people or connections and build relationships and Reporting people and you know, all those things can help going forward. So Yeah. Yeah but it's interesting. Most people are like our level.  We're really interested in it and a bit higher, they do necessary and see around. So just yeah. Yeah. Um and in terms of like the way that you're marketing it, so is it? Is it a revenue stream for envisage, or yeah? Well, that's the idea. Yeah. So what We started off looking.  About it for ourselves working with uh and then we asked like I said, we are some other companies for just some input into the process to make sure we get the functionality right and then you start seeing oh they they would use it and then other people would use it.  And so we appreciate it was just going to be internally for us. But then you can see, there's a lot of elements for other companies that could really help them, and suppose you want you want. Obviously on the revelry Street. But for us it's more about the interested Innovation and talking to other people because we have great ideas and put them into practise and see them actually working at the end of the day.  If you can make a massive approach Improvement for other companies, there's a bit. There's obviously some there's a financial benefit but more about the gratification about starting off with a problem, solving it together. Come up a really good answer. Yeah, interesting. I think it's the way forward selling that AI selling AI capability.  Yeah. Yeah. It's something that, you know, we even spoken about, you know, upstairs mainly our managing director, you know how can we leverage the skills and expertise that we have, you know with Andrew because you know, finds AI, you know, quite interesting, you know, quite sort of like um I don't know how to put like techie.  That type of stuff and it's like how can we actually learn leverage that you know can we leverage that as a service? Yeah yeah. So yeah, I think that's the sort of conversations that people are having at the, at the moment. But yeah, cool. Okay. We'll look forward to hearing.  Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a nice driveway. Hopefully, you get back to a half too. Yes, I'll take care. I love it. Very much.`
