and using AI as well, so trying to enhance that. So it might be a voice call. We'll try not to have a voice call because you're outside for more co-meeting and business-looking meetings as well. So we're just trying to work out a way how to do that, but we'll make them try to record the meeting and create the minutes from it. So I'll get you to see what comes up. Is that right? 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:25
Yeah, I mean, is that- 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:26
Should we just carry on as normal? 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:26
Yeah, we've got that, yeah. Is that your copy of what they normally look like? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:30
So, the idea was- Is this something how you usually want them formatted their meeting minutes? 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:36
Yeah, so I said over to the minutes, 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:37
what was that? Yeah, over. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:39
That was the idea beyond doing this one, though, because you just probably want to, 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:42
the only meetings at the minute that we have like a structured format to it. So it's probably the best one for you to start with. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:51
Right, and I wouldn't change this at all. At all. I think all this format can be improved 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:57
or adapted, but it's good. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:59
Yeah, any suggestions? That's not a problem, it's just more 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:02
for you to base something around. This was one that was probably more structured and had got something you could kind of hear on that and then you've already got minutes to look at and see how those two look. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then in the face, we used children. But it doesn't have to look like that. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:19
So it's just something that one 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:21
that's probably all over the place. And then you're gonna knock. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:25
When you're trying to distance that, 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:26
you're not gonna be able to spot it as well. Obviously I do. Yeah, yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:30
Are you gonna do it on that as well? 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:31
Yeah, I'm gonna just as a fail safe, I'm gonna use my phone to record as well. There we go. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:39
Cool, thank you guys. Nobody's got any objections to that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:45
It's all kept in house as well. And there's not gonna go anywhere and stuff like that. So it's just been set on. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:51
Do you need a half an hour? Or do you need a full meeting? Well, I was setting it for the full meeting. Yeah, yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:57
I'll just text you when we're done. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:58
Yeah, thanks. I'll follow that. Thanks, yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:01
Thank you. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:04
Okay. So then, so the net zero correct. Our meeting with the council is tomorrow. You're diving for tomorrow. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:13
You got that? No. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:15
I don't think so. It's been sent to you, so you probably just need to maybe accept it. No wait, was that? Maybe Monday, not the back end of last week. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:31
From that? 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:33
No, from me. It's made me shine, I love a lot. No, I'll resend it if not. And we can arrange it. It's only the report, thank you. Got that, should be the paper. I'll resend it. I'll get back to my desk. I think it's around 10.30 tomorrow. You need to change it, you can change it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:54
Just grab my hand. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:57
Sorry, we didn't bring it. And who's Nick on that? He sent me a vote, yeah. Actually, no, Nick's not on that meeting, it's just you and me and the guy from the council. And at that point, should we have selected what we're doing? He's gonna discuss through the process, and so we know roughly what we're gonna do, and we're looking at the compressor bunding, the lighting, and the window project. Okay. So that will take us, I'll look at the B's project afterwards, because I couldn't see windows on there, I couldn't see, is that all in thermal insulation? 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:40
Yes. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:46
We can move it if you want. No, it's fine, I just did. Then we'll go through the. No, Nick could agree which ones he wants. Not in particular, if he wants to. We don't know how much funding we're allowed to apply for. That's part of the meeting we're going to have tomorrow. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:58
All right. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:59
If there's a cap on the funding, then then we make a decision as to what's our priority. If there's not, then we might as well try and get as much as possible out of it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:06
Yeah, okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:09
The compressor upgrade, you've got the A4 slide proposal. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:15
Yes, and I'll see that. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:17
That's gonna tie into the ultimate summary. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:19
Yep. Have you thought any more about putting it on that mess? 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:23
We need to get it tested. Tested to the flat weights. I'm not sure it'll take the weight of all those. We're going to compress this, and I don't know how it would benefit it if I'm honest. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:31
Yeah, that's what I'm just gonna ask. What's the. Well, we seem to think it'll throw the heat out better if it could be used then for the heat in the winter. Oh, because it's, yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:47
But the part where it couldn't be direct 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:48
since they're anyway under the studios from the back. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:51
I just don't think the floor will be stable enough for all that kit. He just asked me to bring it up that way. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:56
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:58
So no, I mean, we've not agreed on under the ultimate location. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:03
I think my only thing with compressors 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:06
should have a five, 10 year life of whatever we're doing now with them. And we're saying over the next five to 10 years, we wouldn't want to ever use the office space again. I don't think. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:16
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:18
Do you know what I mean? We're completely taken away at that point. Cause you wouldn't have anything else up there then, would you? Are you talking about the most ones? With a step where we can move the canteen down. Yeah, program canteen. Sorry, I always thought you weren't about 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:30
with the office as well. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:35
Don't know how you get them up there. Okay. Yeah, good luck with that. Okay, has there any, can I just say, you haven't got to any space for a fork with that? No, you haven't. You didn't put anything up there before. Oh, okay. Yeah, you know like. Yeah, when you turn it and then you, otherwise the CMS is going to turn in space. That's a good point actually, cause we did look at, I've been excited to reinforce, you know, using it as a storage. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:00
Yeah, okay. What about that? 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:04
Okay, any issues with any of the CMSs? Nope. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:09
Great. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:11
Any update from the Lotties? No, not that I know of. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:16
Any questions? 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:18
Was there any feedback from them going out to see them in Paris? The only feedback I know about is, it's a long and short of the conversation ended up being that the Lottie were going to go away and relook at the proposal. Yeah, that's what I was. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:31
Okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:38
From a costing point of view, I'm wishing to hear. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:41
Yeah. And then I feel like, one of them, the sales director, 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:48
he's going to be here in a couple of weeks. Okay. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:54
Yeah, not sure on the date though, after cook, man. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:57
For what? 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:00
Okay. You can get jumped inside, if you want. The other dog knows that, the remote one. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:07
Yeah, yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:08
Yeah, he's, and the basically, he said we've got. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:13
So they've used lots of words like, it's probably this, it could be that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:17
It might be that. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:18
It could be possibly. So the gist of the conversation on the stand was more along the lines of, we've asked, you've said it could be a porous material, we don't use porous materials. The model board, we don't do, that's not porous by any shot of the imagination, obviously aluminium isn't. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:38
We don't think they banked on us, 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:41
probably having test results of us, so the last six months, to show that oil and water mix isn't a problem. So therefore that's not what is causing it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:51
And they say the seals went, which the seals shouldn't go. And also originally when that edge was red hot, first time it went, but the seals just peri-sent. And they didn't put new seals back in which, 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:06
so I think Craig went armed with his engineering head on and started talking about DMFEAs and when's the failure point of this seal and what's the temperature of this. And at that point, Mr. Balotti came over and said, we'll go away and have a look at the proposal. But you're never gonna get them to, apparently they've sent that material off for analysis. Whether we'll actually ever find out what it is. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:35
We did do that before we went over all that. I'll let you. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:38
Yeah. But I think while I was trying to keep things amicable at this point in time, 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:45
that was probably the best we could have got 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:48
out of the conversation. And that may well be what the guy's coming over in a couple of weeks. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:52
I'm assuming the second sheet could be a risk 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:54
when whatever's going on on the first one. Yeah, so we went over to visit 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:01
DNS mills machining on Tuesday. Which are a large provider of machines 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:08
placed in back in the Warwick. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:11
They recommended a company called Technova. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:15
Yeah. Which I've never figured out. I've never used it before somewhere 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:18
or we've seen that stuff before. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:20
And they rebuild heads and stuff. But they're literally on a bit of an additional state. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:27
So they're gonna come in and have a look, I think, 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:32
at the current velocity heads. Knox has anything wrong with it at this point in time. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:39
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:40
Will it be something that they'd be able to? 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:42
I think it's when Balotti saw the other one happen, it's gonna come back and we still, none the wiser, why it failed. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:51
I mean, that's the point. That's what I mean, yeah. That's the point in them having a look at the other piece. So they booked me in Technova or? 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:02
No, we're gonna get in touch with Mick next week. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:10
Percose and the two, how are we able to see 17, 830? Is there any issues with those? 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:15
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:16
Which one? 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:17
830. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:18
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:18
The edge's not rotating properly. It's sort of two. We'll get some more or less two and a half degrees out every time we move the edge. Okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:30
If you wanna move horizontally or? John spoke to anyone and reached out to anyone. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:32
Yeah, we said, we'd phone Chris Mayne today, but I wanna speak to Mick to see when them people come in, 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:39
whether he wants them to look at it 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:40
instead of Chris Mayne from the morning. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:44
I mean, if they're really the person that could look at it, there's no reason we shouldn't. I think with the machines is whenever, if we're busy, if something goes down, we want people to respond quickly. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:56
I know that Chris is something that does respond quickly 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:59
or not. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:01
But just having... 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:02
It would be worth getting Chris in first because we've not got a day for petting over yet. You don't want it to be another week though. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:10
How busy is it? 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:12
Sorry? How busy is that machine? 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:13
Not as many as we can. No, good. This is going back to the conversation we had yesterday. Do we need them in straight away? See, we can use it vertical. So it's a usable machine because it's a big one. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:26
But we were trying to put the job on yesterday 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:28
and the one that didn't tip the head. And every time you tipped it at 90, it sort of turned 92 and a half, or... 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:38
We've always gathered the information 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:39
at this point and time and got somebody to look at it and quote us for whatever work needs to be done. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:43
At least I know where we're standing when 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:45
we do want to get it fixed or... Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:48
I mean, they won't come in and say, well, I can do it now. It's three hours. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:52
So we've had the same problem on a machine where I've worked before. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:56
And they come in. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:57
I don't remember whether it was Chris or not. Yeah. But they come in and it was just a bit tweaked 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:04
through the parameters and all that. I think it's worth getting... 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:06
It's a lot of money, though, is it? 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:07
No. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:08
The fire is so... 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:09
Yeah, they didn't take it away. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:10
It was just something they'd done. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:15
Okay. Will you leave that for you to get them in, then, Terry? 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:17
Yeah, I'll find them in when I'm going. I'm going. 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:21
So the Coriadiana then, the pro forma for those repairs have been approved. Navi's making payment on the 15th. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:30
I've had Dan know at Rotatec. 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:33
So as soon as they've received it, they'll schedule that work. The work on the Bridgeport can then be done 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:38
on a PO basis once they've had this pro forma paid. 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:43
So we can raise a PO and get that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:45
And that's on 30 days from end of month, 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:48
that one, the agreed terms on that one. Any issues on the XYZ? 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:55
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:00
Five-axis training, we're no further along, gone with any decision on all that. That's fine, then. Access to equipment has been ordered today for the three primary access doors, the two outside doors, and the one that goes from reception into the workshop. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:16
Yeah, okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:17
Yeah. Since that arrives, Paul will be on that to get those three up and running. I think it might do on the... And the orders are just going today. So once we've received the confirmation, 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:30
that'll give us the indications to deliver them. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:34
They're an off-the-shelf part, 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:35
which should only be a matter of days. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:39
Anything else for Harold Way before we move on to Ploegor's class? 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:43
No, we just need a date for the IBC so we can get them. So that was meant to be yesterday. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:51
And then obviously got to lay everything because she needed a safety day, is she? I haven't heard from Debbie this morning. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:55
No, she's got to say, 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:55
but thanks for the information, we'll get back. Yeah, so I'll chase her this afternoon as to when that's been rearranged for. 
SPEAKER 2 0:14:05
There's loads of lights gone in the canteen. They've all seem to have gone this week. Yeah. And there's a couple of lights in the studio gone. 
SPEAKER 1 0:14:17
Okay. 
SPEAKER 2 0:14:22
I'll send Paul over. 
SPEAKER 1 0:14:27
You can take a look. 
SPEAKER 2 0:14:28
The machine's in the studio. Yeah. John Dunke seems to want to move them. Okay. So instead of having the trail from the plug, the cable all the way to them, we seem to think they can just put an hole in the wall, small hole in the wall, through to boy and his machine. Put the cable through, put the power in from there. So, please put the lathe grinder and the little one up. 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:01
Okay. 
SPEAKER 2 0:15:02
And the manual machines, if they're building anything, they just go in and flip. Because you really want to move them to the back. Yeah. But what they've been doing, they've been trailing. 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:10
The cables across. 
SPEAKER 2 0:15:11
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:12
But should we not move them into the back, please? That's where Terry wanted to move them. That's what he just said. John doesn't want to. If you let me know what the plan is, and then we can, because we have to put in some additional power 
SPEAKER 2 0:15:24
at the back anyway, but, 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:25
I mean, we just need to know for sure where you want them. Long-term position is that that studio 
SPEAKER 2 0:15:30
is supposed to be for outer space work. 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:32
Therefore, 
SPEAKER 2 0:15:33
It needs to be cleaned. It needs to be, there needs to be out of that. So there's no point in doing this stuff. And so the reason we said you would just put a little hole in for the time being, and just flip the tape through. 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:45
Just for an elf, just for an elf and say. Yeah, I think if ultimately they need to be moved, like it can be moved though. Just move it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:15:52
Just move it and get, 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:53
do it once, do it once, once, and into it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:15:55
Yeah, well, I'll do that. 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:57
I'll talk to you then. 
SPEAKER 2 0:15:59
I'll talk to you then. I'll talk to you then. Okay, I'll send Paul over to have a look at the lights. 
SPEAKER 1 0:16:08
Yeah. Otherwise, if John and I will just raise some maintenance tickets when they go. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:16:13
Otherwise we can put that up straight away then. 
SPEAKER 1 0:16:17
Progress closed then. The lift repair is still in the same position as now. If I was on my way, we wouldn't have any agreement. 
SPEAKER 2 0:16:23
I just hasn't received anything. 
SPEAKER 1 0:16:26
The containers are being collected next Thursday, which is the 13th, I believe. And they're delivering your one here at the same time. 
SPEAKER 2 0:16:34
Awesome. 
SPEAKER 1 0:16:39
No outstanding issues in the Ola studio. Well, apart from the spindle stuff and everything. Yeah, so I spoke to, yes, we can add that. So I spoke to Dave about the spindles because he impression he gave Terry was that they were all. 
SPEAKER 2 0:16:52
Yeah, he said definitely do. 
SPEAKER 1 0:16:53
Yeah, I emailed him as she saw. And he said they all, they work, they're slow at working. So Terry's given one of them to rotate yesterday on the basis to see what they combat with because if they can be refurbed or improved on, we can get all the Ola ones done. If not, then we go down the route of having to consider whether we upgrade them or see what ITP can do with them. I know they're looked in, once they go past a certain point, 
SPEAKER 2 0:17:20
ITP won't touch them, there's no point. 
SPEAKER 1 0:17:23
But the post test is a bit more confident in there. 
SPEAKER 2 0:17:25
Just to see about that pro forma and say to that, and he said, you say, well, have you had a chance to look at me? 
SPEAKER 1 0:17:31
And he also- 
SPEAKER 2 0:17:32
Larry Posey's getting the pro forma for Larry Martin. Exactly. To have a look at these spindles. 
SPEAKER 1 0:17:36
Yeah, and he also taught the one which is slightly different to the Ola ones that blew in Shuegloo 2. Wasn't as confident about that one, was it? 
SPEAKER 2 0:17:44
No, it's just solid, that is it. 
SPEAKER 1 0:17:48
So, more ego and sonic probably. The spindles from Ola, 
SPEAKER 2 0:17:55
they fit in Shuegloo 2? Different fittings and close out. 
SPEAKER 1 0:18:00
But what? I think what Terry's maybe suggested and I think Mick has suggested before, as I'm because the Londoners in having our, if we can get those ones that Ola's got, because they're similar to what we've got next door, aren't they? Studio 13. 
SPEAKER 2 0:18:14
Well, I didn't know there was any in there. 
SPEAKER 1 0:18:15
Yeah, if we can get them adapted by our electronics team, 
SPEAKER 2 0:18:18
maybe we can use them in Shuegloo 2. But- 
SPEAKER 1 0:18:22
Yeah, no, that's all I was thinking. At the moment, as you saw on the mail, yes, we need to have them ready for Ola. 
SPEAKER 2 0:18:30
But he's turned off all his resource, 
SPEAKER 1 0:18:33
so not actually- 
SPEAKER 2 0:18:35
No. 
SPEAKER 1 0:18:36
But at least we can get ahead of the game a little bit. And if we can be further and use them here as well, all the better. But it will depend on what Rotatec say, whether they can do anything with them or not. But I think our electronics guys have got one of them anyway, because Mick O'Sullivan took one from 13. 
SPEAKER 2 0:18:54
Yeah, there is one in there. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:19:00
AML are happy, as far as I'm aware, in their studios. And I think in Studio 2, I believe there's only one of the XGC bodies left now. I think they took one out this week. So, yeah, well, John Morrell asked me for some access. So that's what you're on game mail about. 
SPEAKER 2 0:19:16
I think that would be the card back. Yeah, I think that's what it was. 
SPEAKER 1 0:19:21
The Lotus Waste, I have quotes in, well, I have the costing in for the metal. 
SPEAKER 2 0:19:25
I'm just waiting for the clay skip, 
SPEAKER 1 0:19:28
and I need a cost of a guy to break it down. Yeah, what we charge them. 
SPEAKER 2 0:19:34
Rake it and make it look different than Shrodo bin, I guess. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:19:38
So just need kind of what a rape we charge them to that, and I can send them over the cost then. 7.29, I mean, our next Thursday, I think it is Wednesday or Thursday, to have a look if they're confident that what we believe was causing the leak, 
SPEAKER 2 0:19:51
or what they thought was a leak is, as we say. 
SPEAKER 1 0:19:55
Hopefully we can close that one out. The mess has been cleared right down. You saw that, did it count on Tuesday? Yeah, I need to get them some pictures. I thought I'd open some pictures. There's a few IT bits there, and then a bit of... Look, I've just emailed IZ, Sandy's going to go and have a look this week at hers. 
SPEAKER 2 0:20:14
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:20:15
But most of it's been brought down from the mess. Yeah, you were going to go and have a look at the other bits and get the couple of bits when you get chance next week. 
SPEAKER 2 0:20:23
I'll go and make a look. Email me and Mick is adding you for some stuff. I'll go home and have a look. 
SPEAKER 1 0:20:30
Yeah, and Craig, actually. He just decided, like I said, if it's all for the scrap, we can just get rid. 
SPEAKER 2 0:20:36
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:20:37
Clear a lot of space. Okay, and then the boardroom model Mick asked which we brought over to Doyle. Don't know if a driver's done that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:20:47
I didn't realise that was on me, so yeah, 
SPEAKER 1 0:20:49
I saw that today. I'll move that over. There was? 
SPEAKER 2 0:20:52
Which model is it? 
SPEAKER 1 0:20:53
In the boardroom there's like a, is it a flight seat? Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:20:59
It's the only one in there. Yeah, that's fine. 
SPEAKER 1 0:21:02
When he's passing, or when he's over, 
SPEAKER 2 0:21:03
I wouldn't grab it, no? 
SPEAKER 1 0:21:05
I think it's quite heavy, so you might need a hand lift in it. Well, I remember. Got an only base. 
SPEAKER 2 0:21:09
That's fine. It's a metal base, not the part. 
SPEAKER 1 0:21:12
Do you know what I mean? 
SPEAKER 2 0:21:13
Yeah, it's fine. 
SPEAKER 1 0:21:16
Anyone got anything else for Progos, please? Nope. So, Doyle Drive then, I got the check and balance done that one's great, and I sent that over to Durham. Does he see on his reply about the plate? 
SPEAKER 2 0:21:31
No. So, to Mick. 
SPEAKER 1 0:21:36
He's saying that the reason, apparently they spoke to Lee about this when they did the calibration last year, reason it's out by the thrill of mail is to do with the thickness of our plate, and they can't make any repairs on it because of the thickness of the plate. So when I read that, I feel like we all knew that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:21:51
I feel like that has definitely been talked about. 
SPEAKER 1 0:21:54
For me, it twelves me. Yeah. About the plate, it's never gonna be good enough to do a dimensional model or anything like that in Studio One. But not probably to the extent of what it is. Yeah. Does that ring a bell with you? 
SPEAKER 2 0:22:13
I don't really know, because I've not been in probably these meetings 
SPEAKER 1 0:22:19
where we've been born in and forever, so I don't know. 
SPEAKER 2 0:22:21
No, I can't remember that. I know you mentioned that they probably 
SPEAKER 1 0:22:24
didn't have for a while. Yeah, definitely from a plate perspective. But I don't think we've probably realised how much to the extent, like the further up the arms you went, it was gonna be out. So I think it makes us for the calibration report, 
SPEAKER 2 0:22:39
just to see exactly what their results were showing. 
SPEAKER 1 0:22:43
That's what we've got. 
SPEAKER 2 0:22:43
It's actually got progressively worse than that, because yeah, I think that will give us a bit of info, 
SPEAKER 1 0:22:50
but I think we don't really need to use that Studio as a dimensional studio there. 
SPEAKER 2 0:22:56
No, it was sort of on the basis of the 4.7 Show of Class built over those two studio. We've got our way round there. It would be nice to have another dimensional studio, yes. So, yeah, it doesn't happen right now. It's not the end of the world. No, I think it's, 
SPEAKER 1 0:23:16
as long as we know what it's capable of doing. 
SPEAKER 2 0:23:19
With either, yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:23:21
Yeah, and that's it, because we've never been standing up. 
SPEAKER 2 0:23:24
It can't be done. 
SPEAKER 1 0:23:27
Studio two then, you've been asked to tell me about that inventory. He's done that. Did he give it to you? 
SPEAKER 2 0:23:33
No. No, he has done it. Okay. I've not seen it myself, 
SPEAKER 1 0:23:38
but I watched him typing it, 
SPEAKER 2 0:23:39
or when I walked past him, so. 
SPEAKER 1 0:23:40
Oh, I'll pop down and see him then. Well, I've always been off the back of that email yesterday. I've put my cops' bars on a sheet and some other bits. 
SPEAKER 2 0:23:51
So if he, yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:23:52
Has it to that? He just emailed it to me, and I'm going to go 
SPEAKER 2 0:23:56
and add it onto the back of that. 
SPEAKER 1 0:23:59
Yep. Brilliant. 
SPEAKER 2 0:24:02
He's done a spreadsheet rather than a piece of paper. Pop him facing it on there. 
SPEAKER 1 0:24:07
At least because he's there was a knee. It was, I was. It was some of the legends. 
SPEAKER 2 0:24:10
It was legends, that's all I thought. Squiggle. Yeah, it was a billboard, so. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:24:16
Studio three, the lighting will be done ready for you on Monday. 
SPEAKER 2 0:24:19
Okay. Yep. 
SPEAKER 1 0:24:21
So we'll untrap with that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:24:22
Yeah. Studio four, five, six. 
SPEAKER 1 0:24:27
There's no issues in there at the moment. Studio seven, the extraction stuff's been pulled out now, hasn't it? I saw it out on, or at least the front of the container. 
SPEAKER 2 0:24:38
Yeah, the containers were fully emptied and so on. 
SPEAKER 1 0:24:41
Yeah, I know when I went past it, I think it was at the front of the container, so I'll get Michael's have a look over that next week and see what we can do and what we can use in Andy's area. At least one of them anyway. Okay, the lead working crew, we know about that, and that's not gonna be done now until we've got a job to quote for. So that's with Andy. She's eight and nine, the works start on those next week. So I was in there this morning and let Craig, it was okay to keep in there as long as it's covered, it won't be in the way, but he's gonna get the model out. It's already here. 
SPEAKER 2 0:25:20
Ah, fantastic. 
SPEAKER 1 0:25:23
Just wanna do a check, everyone has picked up off the mail that's been sent. The plate area is gonna have to be called enough 
SPEAKER 2 0:25:34
and we're not gonna be able to use it for a month. For 30 days, yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:25:37
Yeah, that's fine. 
SPEAKER 2 0:25:38
I just... 
SPEAKER 1 0:25:39
Mick came to ask me about it afterwards, so I don't know if he's picked it up. To make sure I probably need to have a conversation with Craig just to make sure he's aware. Yeah, thank you. I don't know how it's gonna affect his... 
SPEAKER 2 0:25:50
Well, John and... Yeah, John spoke to me about it, and asked how he's aware of it already. Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:25:56
For it as you all... John Morrell. Oh, so Craig must have asked him. 
SPEAKER 2 0:25:58
Spoke to him about it off the back of the email then. Okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:26:05
So Studio 10, the world area. Well, I just need to... You can't just have a notice. We've got some new lights for in there because a couple went out. It's not causing many issues, so we're upgrading the lights. They've been here for a while, so if you can just let us know when, if that area is quiet or free at any point. 
SPEAKER 2 0:26:22
Yeah, I mean, you can probably do it any time. It's only normally... 
SPEAKER 1 0:26:26
It's just because we'll be working over the plate, so it's not necessarily one of the changing lights. 
SPEAKER 2 0:26:31
There's bits and bobs at the minute, and the resident weld is laid off, so it's only reaving and out at the moment, so now it's a bad time. 
SPEAKER 1 0:26:43
Is that all right? 
SPEAKER 2 0:26:44
That's the next couple of weeks. Yeah, it's like it, yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:26:50
Just so interesting, who fed back that it wasn't causing many problems? Is that them, that the people in the area that's fed back? 
SPEAKER 2 0:26:56
Yes. OK. Only because they said the opposite. 
SPEAKER 1 0:27:01
Yeah, they said the opposite to me. 
SPEAKER 2 0:27:02
Dark ones. 
SPEAKER 1 0:27:03
So I just wondered if... Yeah, no, it wasn't really, because it's been a little while ago, it's been a few months ago when they went, but it was Rolex. At that point, Rolex was the one working in there. 
SPEAKER 2 0:27:14
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:27:14
But no, no one's mentioned it. No, that's fine. She said they had, we can get it done, because we can say the parts are on site, they've been on site since Rolex first reported it, so. OK. She was 11 and 12, all we had in there was the faulty bike ramp. So the bike ramp said not to be faulty. 
SPEAKER 2 0:27:37
Oh, OK. 
SPEAKER 1 0:27:38
So we did some troubleshooting over the phone, which is what Machine Mart wanted to do before they sent it out. 
SPEAKER 2 0:27:42
And basically there is a black pipe 
SPEAKER 1 0:27:46
that holds the lift in place, so it's two lifting positions. None of them were being used on any of the lifts. So I asked them why the others weren't dropping as well. And they said it might just have been that you didn't have as much weight or the seals were slightly better on them, but you shouldn't be using the bike lifts if you've spoken to Joe and Nick about them without this safety bar. All the bars were in the studio covered in dust. They just had never been used. 
SPEAKER 2 0:28:12
All right. 
SPEAKER 1 0:28:13
So I think that was the next word. 
SPEAKER 2 0:28:14
If we get new equipment in onsite, 
SPEAKER 1 0:28:17
that I know we register it, it's just that we make sure people, I'm sure they come with an instruction sheet on how to use it, but whether we need to just read it. Yeah. But to be honest with you, it might be something you need to do, or I'm sure Karen, Chris, 40 or Michael, whatever, when we get a new bit of kit in, I'm not saying you should have to do this, but just run through, do one operation on it, and make sure anybody is using it where this is the correct way you need to use this, 
SPEAKER 2 0:28:54
because it is a bit of a lifting kit, isn't it really? 
SPEAKER 1 0:28:57
So I appreciate you might not think you should have to. No, no, I do. There was a safety bar that they've not been used in. Yeah, no, I get the safety bar thing, they were used in, but I feel like they're still having to sound a little bit. 
SPEAKER 2 0:29:11
They still shouldn't be dropping. 
SPEAKER 1 0:29:12
But it shouldn't be used by the bar. Yeah, but if you... So it's not dropping with the bar. 
SPEAKER 2 0:29:16
Yes, but no, ignore the bar, jack and eel, and then it starts falling. 
SPEAKER 1 0:29:20
You might not have time to get the bar in. 
SPEAKER 2 0:29:22
Well, there's... So it still shouldn't drop on its own. 
SPEAKER 1 0:29:25
You do have time to get the bar in because I lifted it the other week, I didn't know about the bar, 
SPEAKER 2 0:29:29
I lifted it the week and it didn't drop for a few hours. 
SPEAKER 1 0:29:32
So you've got time to get the bar in. 
SPEAKER 2 0:29:33
But if the seal was to go more, 
SPEAKER 1 0:29:35
that he's saying that it might be a dodgy seal. I'm happy to go back to him, but that's the thing, that's what I think. I don't think there's any odds to me, but I'm just saying it isn't, 
SPEAKER 2 0:29:41
probably not as straightforward as what we are. 
SPEAKER 1 0:29:43
Sort of, no, 
SPEAKER 2 0:29:45
I mean, bike ramps are bike ramps. 
SPEAKER 1 0:29:46
All the guys probably got one in the garage at home 
SPEAKER 2 0:29:48
and they probably never put safety bar in, 
SPEAKER 1 0:29:49
so that's why they don't do it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:29:51
And we didn't know that it was safe. 
SPEAKER 1 0:29:52
It's fine, it can feel... Yeah, it's not necessarily safe, but it keeps it at what you pumped up. On the lift, there's only two heights it can ever be, or ever it should be, and it keeps it at the height selected. 
SPEAKER 2 0:30:03
No, it's not, I have no problem whatsoever with that, 
SPEAKER 1 0:30:05
but I do think they're probably using that 
SPEAKER 2 0:30:07
as a bit of an excuse. It probably is a little bit faulty, 
SPEAKER 1 0:30:10
but they don't want to replace it. Okay, I'm a good excuse, I do think. 
SPEAKER 2 0:30:12
They're not using it properly anyway. 
SPEAKER 1 0:30:14
I'm happy to go back to them if you want me to. But also then, so as I was explaining to Joe, one of the lifts that's now in 13 hasn't got them. We can't find the black bar. 
SPEAKER 2 0:30:24
We'll get one later. 
SPEAKER 1 0:30:25
So you need to replace that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:30:27
Yeah, I think we've got some smaller rows around. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:30:31
And will you relate that to the guys as well, 
SPEAKER 2 0:30:32
so they know not to use that? 
SPEAKER 1 0:30:34
Yeah, they're not here in a minute, so... No, I mean, so they need to use the bar in future when we do the lifts. 
SPEAKER 2 0:30:38
I know it's our suit, but if... 
SPEAKER 1 0:30:41
I'm sure we'd be able to go online and download the working instruction form. Yeah, but imagine so. Well, I'm just thinking that we've got two areas 
SPEAKER 2 0:30:52
that are specifically art studios, haven't we? So there's no reason we couldn't have it as an A3 or an A4. 
SPEAKER 1 0:30:58
If you tell me what the equipment is, I'll have a look. 
SPEAKER 2 0:31:00
And then just... 
SPEAKER 1 0:31:01
Maybe we can just pick a notice on it anyway, 
SPEAKER 2 0:31:03
just to say, for the user out of these bars in place. 
SPEAKER 1 0:31:05
Yeah, just something. 
SPEAKER 2 0:31:06
I think we should just cover ourselves, 
SPEAKER 1 0:31:08
because... The product itself, as in... I had a wench one at the end. Yeah, Lindsay was here. Lindsay, yeah. Yeah, to get that machine. I think let's just say, for ourselves, because if it's just one of those things that... Probably not. Just so I get the right one. Jack, there's three or four different types on the market, and some of them, you probably can jack it, it just holds, and then there's... 
SPEAKER 2 0:31:31
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:31:32
You have to put a bar in or whatever, 
SPEAKER 2 0:31:34
so let's just cover ourselves from that. 
SPEAKER 1 0:31:38
OK. Mecco Ferry then. So I had an update from Guard Tech during the week, the minute they're scheduled to deliver the guards back to us mid-April. OK. 
SPEAKER 2 0:31:50
So I've preempted the Euro CNC or any other sort of thing now, 
SPEAKER 1 0:31:57
to see if anything would be able to be made in April, 
SPEAKER 2 0:31:59
whether it's for them service-wise. 
SPEAKER 1 0:32:02
And then we need to lock it, if it does, if that works, if we can make that work as well. Because obviously, the guards have finished mid-April, we don't have to fit them at the egg pool. No, no, yeah, it should be done. 
SPEAKER 2 0:32:12
It works, yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:32:14
But just trying to see if we get stuff in line. If it doesn't work for them, then we can look at later in May and making sure it works for you guys as well. The new belt is being fitted now. Was fitted yesterday, as you know. 
SPEAKER 2 0:32:27
He's just calibrating it. 
SPEAKER 1 0:32:29
And I spent seeing before this meeting things are going to plan. Is it at the moment? So hopefully by the end of the day, 
SPEAKER 2 0:32:34
I can make our sugar back from running. 
SPEAKER 1 0:32:37
I had the reports. 
SPEAKER 2 0:32:38
I'm going to guarantee it, will you? I can't guarantee it, will he? 
SPEAKER 1 0:32:42
Oh, can you go up and tell him? 
SPEAKER 2 0:32:43
I can't guarantee it anymore. 
SPEAKER 1 0:32:45
Get out of the area. I get out of the area. 
SPEAKER 2 0:32:48
Might guarantee to bend the roof. 
SPEAKER 1 0:32:50
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. So I sent the drives up to you. So I can send them, of course, from out of your car. Yeah. That's fine. That's fine. Well, that's how you know. She's got ankles in her car, Terry. She's got a fine look. 
SPEAKER 2 0:33:06
So we've had the reports back from the chorus of the drives that we sent up. 
SPEAKER 1 0:33:15
They would refurb both those two drives for 800 each. So then we'd have two working drives as spares. So that's C800. We just paid 1,400 for a new one. 
SPEAKER 2 0:33:28
So that's the difference in those. 
SPEAKER 1 0:33:30
We also sent them because we found a power unit as a spare as well. 
SPEAKER 2 0:33:37
But it was didn't work. 
SPEAKER 1 0:33:39
So we sent that up and got them to have a look at that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:33:42
They could refurb that for. Where did we find the power unit from? 
SPEAKER 1 0:33:48
I think it might have been under the MECOF. 
SPEAKER 2 0:33:50
That must have been what they found at the MECOF. 
SPEAKER 1 0:33:54
For a 1900. Now I've been told that if we would have to buy a new one, then it's around 6K. That's if you could find one. So I went down and spoke to Dan from EuroCNC. I also spoke to him about whether he's worked with these people before. Because he obviously recommended whether he's worked with the kit that they refurbished. 
SPEAKER 2 0:34:11
He has and he's found their work to be quite good. But I'll send those figures over to everyone so you can have a look at making a decision about getting those spares. 
SPEAKER 1 0:34:27
The motor's been ordered obviously for the cabinet at the back of the MECOF. 
SPEAKER 2 0:34:31
None that was vibrating. 
SPEAKER 1 0:34:33
We're just waiting for a delivery scheduled for that supplier over in Germany. Anyone else on the MECOF? 
SPEAKER 2 0:34:46
Oh, so ethics, I think. 
SPEAKER 1 0:34:49
Was MECOF Sullivan going to work on the inventory of the equipment that we did find under there? 
SPEAKER 2 0:34:54
Lewis got that. You've got that, Lewis? 
SPEAKER 1 0:35:04
So electronics, I needed to add the LED units they've got there to the register. I've gone and got the details for those. 
SPEAKER 2 0:35:11
And just sent them over to Beta as well. So that was the other thing. 
SPEAKER 1 0:35:18
Sorry, for that MECOF barrier. 
SPEAKER 2 0:35:20
Has he come back with a date yet? 
SPEAKER 1 0:35:22
No. 
SPEAKER 2 0:35:30
When that guy come... 
SPEAKER 1 0:35:32
Yes, he went and said that on. He looked at the spare spindle. This is the guy from Rotatec. 
SPEAKER 2 0:35:38
Yes, they refurbished. But the guy asked him to put ship bearings in him. Guy asked him... So if that spindle goes and the fit of that one, it won't run to so many refs. Because he told him to put ceramics in. He re-served it originally and the guy told him to put a second right bearings in it. 
SPEAKER 1 0:35:59
And this is the spindle we've got on the shelf, is it? Yes. Oh, we think. 
SPEAKER 2 0:36:05
Guy said... 
SPEAKER 1 0:36:07
You're going to look at it, isn't he? 
SPEAKER 2 0:36:09
So I've found the quota out with their number on. Yes. And I've emailed him today just to say, can you just go and look at your report and see what bearings you put on. Don't die. It's not ceramic. I'll just say, can you just give a quote and then we'll just look at it and see how... I mean, I wouldn't have a clue how much it would have. OK. 
SPEAKER 1 0:36:30
No, if he can send us a copy of that report, then we've got it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:36:34
Yes. On the quote it says, downgraded bearings. So I'm pretty certain they're not ceramic. 
SPEAKER 1 0:36:43
So we've got a spindle on the shelf that isn't the same spindle as the one we've got on the machine. 
SPEAKER 2 0:36:47
That's right. 
SPEAKER 1 0:36:49
So if that goes, that's bad, isn't it a light for light? 
SPEAKER 2 0:36:51
It can run it. It's not a light for light yet. I think Guy's idea was because it would be a cut of probably aluminium with these low passive bearings. I know he sends backwards but it will cut aluminium but very slowly and very small cuts. I can't see the report. I can't see his logic in him, to be fair. 
SPEAKER 1 0:37:13
Because we don't put aluminium down there. 
SPEAKER 2 0:37:15
Exactly. OK. 
SPEAKER 1 0:37:19
OK, so Dan's going to look at the report and then we can get the different... Get him to quote for what the difference is. 
SPEAKER 2 0:37:24
I'll just ask him and then we can just make a decision, Bob. OK. I mean, Bob, you can do it in six months and just hope the spindle don't go but if it does, we can... 
SPEAKER 1 0:37:35
I just think with the mass stuff that's been going on there, there's no point having a spare on the shelf that isn't a light for light match. 
SPEAKER 2 0:37:43
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:37:44
Because it's not the air to deliver at the speed that you will have planned. 
SPEAKER 2 0:37:47
Yeah. But if... 
SPEAKER 1 0:37:49
It depends on the cost, isn't it? 
SPEAKER 2 0:37:51
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:37:53
Be interesting to see what the cost difference would have been originally. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:37:57
And they refilled it. OK. Put sample in an area then so we need to do your air, just to see the air stop still. Yeah. Can't see the kitchen. That's all been cleared now. 
SPEAKER 1 0:38:18
Have we got any spare racking? 
SPEAKER 2 0:38:21
Potentially. 
SPEAKER 1 0:38:23
I thought that would be good to go up there so we can start. 
SPEAKER 2 0:38:28
Yeah, I'll have one for you. 
SPEAKER 1 0:38:29
It's just full of alcohol, foxes and stuff like that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:38:32
OK. 
SPEAKER 1 0:38:40
The guys are doing well with the equipment lists. The only studios I haven't received any from, I know they were going to do one of these for the studios, one and twelve. Yeah, I've seen it in the studio. 
SPEAKER 2 0:38:50
You showed me it. Oh, I just need to... 
SPEAKER 1 0:38:53
Yeah, I've seen it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:38:54
...get to move out of place. Yeah. Well, when he showed me, he's almost done this now and I thought he would then bring it to you. He's on the walls. Unless he's put it in the timesheet box which gets collected on a Monday. 
SPEAKER 1 0:39:06
Oh, OK. 
SPEAKER 2 0:39:07
Either way, if it's been done, that's fine. I think we can get it on. 
SPEAKER 1 0:39:10
And my guys have started this week doing their more in-depth checks for the studios. So this week, studios one, two and three have been done and then they do a different area each Monday. 
SPEAKER 2 0:39:23
So by the month end, the whole site has been covered. The extendable booths, we've sent the PO for the addition to the size. That's gone over today, during our second today. 
SPEAKER 1 0:39:37
So we should be able to get an ETA on delivery times. 
SPEAKER 2 0:39:42
Yes, so that was extended to the... 
SPEAKER 1 0:39:44
Size a bit lifted, yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:39:46
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:39:48
I know you were saying weren't you about moving the ovens? Yeah, I think we'll just get it done and... 
SPEAKER 2 0:39:54
Or the top end. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:39:58
OK. Anything else before we move on to the generalised stuff and common stuff? In front of the studios or in the workspaces? 
SPEAKER 2 0:40:14
No. Of course, minor ones, but I don't need to discuss them. 
SPEAKER 1 0:40:18
OK. That's fine. Yep, no worries. So, driving licences. Yeah, I'm still... I haven't had anybody from Andy's area, so I know Mark Burns driven it, Chris Knight, still haven't had any of them. Everybody else I've had. Yep. 
SPEAKER 2 0:40:41
Oh, yeah, we've all had it. 
SPEAKER 1 0:40:43
Yeah. Driver vacancy, that was going to go out, wasn't it? Yeah, I've naturally put the vacancy back out of some... 
SPEAKER 2 0:40:55
Using costly shells and... 
SPEAKER 1 0:40:58
Exactly what's entailed getting the different licences. 
SPEAKER 2 0:41:03
So, can have a bit more of a constructive conversation with anybody on the shark, having a baudelaire to deliver models, if that makes sense. 
SPEAKER 1 0:41:16
It isn't necessarily a bad thing, considering we end up having to send them down a lot of the time anyway. 
SPEAKER 2 0:41:21
Yeah. And then with the... I know, we'll leave the electronics team now taking the video of the arrival van. So, the quicker we can get that, the salt quicker we can get. 
SPEAKER 1 0:41:41
I wouldn't say it's mid-sized, but it's winter or something on those lines where... It can deal with the day-to-day stuff a bit more. 
SPEAKER 2 0:41:50
Yep. So, you're just dealing with the sale of that and all... 
SPEAKER 1 0:41:54
To Aquaria? Aquaria, yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:41:56
Well, ultimately, it's obviously to Aquaria, so... Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:42:03
So, the paint container, we've already spoke about that activity on Thursday. The winter replacement program is part of our discussions with the council, if we fund it. First aid is, you need some more volunteers from the shop floor. No, I'm fine. I've got... Okay. Joe's given me another two, and then I think I've got at least another four or five that will do the next one. So, I'm happy with that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:42:27
Yep. 
SPEAKER 1 0:42:29
Is there any updates you need to speak about regarding the face-fit testing? Yeah, I've looked at a couple of courses, and I've got somebody doing a bit of research for me, but you said you wanted somebody else to do... The training. I think you should do it, again, because you're head of all that, but I need somebody else that you would nominate. I need two people at least, because if one's off... 
SPEAKER 2 0:42:52
To do the training, to do the test. 
SPEAKER 1 0:42:54
To do the training, yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:42:55
Yeah, to do the training, which then allows you to do the test. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:42:58
Yeah, I'll be fine. I think you need two people. 
SPEAKER 2 0:43:00
I'll be fine using my materials, yeah. It's fine. 
SPEAKER 1 0:43:02
Yeah, you just let me know who, and then we'll... 
SPEAKER 2 0:43:04
Yeah, set it up. 
SPEAKER 1 0:43:07
I was just going to mention, Rollership Adores. I know we've still got the one at Herr but we've got two pounds back, haven't we? And you said that somebody was interested. 
SPEAKER 2 0:43:16
Yeah, we just spoke about Mark wanting one of them. Yeah. But ultimately, we need to get them shifted now, I guess, so... They were happy for Mark to purchase one, and... 
SPEAKER 1 0:43:26
I don't know how we'd price it or whatever we're going to do. I don't know, but... 
SPEAKER 2 0:43:30
Yeah, let's have a chat with Nav. 
SPEAKER 1 0:43:37
OK. You've seen the 5S, you know what's on it. We've got a bit outstanding, but we had a bit of a walk this morning. We've got a Cosh cabinet issue. So, we went into stores, but we went in the paint area, your paint store. And I think there's three cabinets there that aren't even Cosh cabinets. So, we can't use them. They don't have flip trays in them. 
SPEAKER 2 0:43:59
Yeah, a lot of those originally were just painted yellow. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:44:03
So, Paul's looking at an alternative to see if we can take the bottom out and put our own drip trays in them. 
SPEAKER 2 0:44:10
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:44:11
If not, they need clearing, but you've got an awful lot of stuff on top of the cabinets. We've got two cabinets that are two-thirds empty. 
SPEAKER 2 0:44:17
Yeah, we went through this the other day. I've got probably a third of the paint in there that's outdated now. Yeah. I've got spare paint labor next week. I have to have somebody paint clear it out because they know what it is. Yeah. They're all going to have a good gut, 
SPEAKER 1 0:44:31
because that rack as well is behind the booth. 
SPEAKER 2 0:44:33
That's all now, well out of date. Yeah. We can just palette that up, right? Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:44:37
Yes. 
SPEAKER 2 0:44:38
Palette it up, let you know what it is, and send it. 
SPEAKER 1 0:44:40
Whatever you do on the cabinets, if you can leave the bottom to have three of all of them, then we can look at getting drip trays painted so we don't have to buy any more. Risk assessment sign-in sheet. I've not got one signature on it yet. No. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I do do while they're quiet. 
SPEAKER 2 0:44:57
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:44:58
They should be having a readable. Just a reminder, you've got exposure monitoring next week. They're going to concentrate mainly on the paint area, I think, and Andy's area. They'll do everywhere, but I think they're the two main areas. And they'll attach the personal monitors onto some of them, but I won't know who they are. Yeah, that's all. They're not. And they're coming to do Herald Way on Thursday. Okay. So it's just so somebody's there to welcome them in and show them the ameans, because then after that they're fine. And... Sorry. Will they be able to do Herald Way properly on Thursday? You've got a couple of machines running out, okay? 
SPEAKER 2 0:45:35
Okay. We've got a couple. 
SPEAKER 1 0:45:37
We might not have Thursday. I don't know. Can we put something on to run something? Just otherwise it's no point in them running out. No, well, that's what I'm just thinking, really, is it? Because I know you had some running out on Tuesday. Yeah. I don't know. There's chances of running out on Thursday. 
SPEAKER 2 0:45:54
I don't know. The chances are we won't have anything come Tuesday, this Tuesday. But again, we could have a load released tomorrow. 
SPEAKER 1 0:46:02
Do you think you'd know by Tuesday morning? 
SPEAKER 2 0:46:05
Yes. 
SPEAKER 1 0:46:06
So if you just at least advise Karen by Tuesday. And then if I have to change the Herald one at last minute? 
SPEAKER 2 0:46:12
Okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:46:14
Yeah, we'll have to see what they say, but it's... 
SPEAKER 2 0:46:16
I might not believe it's bad. 
SPEAKER 1 0:46:18
They turn up and then they're on all the time. Yeah. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:46:22
And we were thinking the other day, you know, when you move your models around here, 
SPEAKER 1 0:46:25
you've got your clays and what have you, those back to car park spaces, the one where the tyres are, we need them going, but we need to crosshatch those two car park spaces. Okay. Because at the minute you're turning points more tight. And if you have a fire engine in this car park, they can't turn. And then you're going to have to turn it off. And if you have a fire engine in this car park, they can't turn. 
SPEAKER 2 0:46:52
Okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:46:53
I know we've got that... So you've got this, yeah, so you need the two the other side. So one of them you don't use anyways, it's got tyres in it. So it needs to be that one and the one next to it. That we clear them and crosshatch them. 
SPEAKER 2 0:47:05
Okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:47:06
And it just gives us a full turning point then if we've got to take models and that round. Okay. 
SPEAKER 2 0:47:12
Okay. That's about it from me. 
SPEAKER 1 0:47:20
Oh, sorry. 
SPEAKER 2 0:47:21
It's not. You're all right. 
SPEAKER 1 0:47:23
Just to remind everybody, your first aid's on the 19th of this month. Right. And then, yeah, that's it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:47:39
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:47:42
There's Joe Garlister, he's on the first aid, so he knows nobody's got a holiday on the first aid. That's going to pop a due in because it all didn't use, so you've seen it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:47:49
Okay. Yeah. Anything else for anyone? 
SPEAKER 1 0:47:58
I don't know. Okay. 
SPEAKER 2 0:48:03
Thank you. Some reason we've put it in there. Lesson. 
SPEAKER 1 0:48:33
Hello, we're finished. 
SPEAKER 2 0:48:35
Okay. Thanks. Quick question. How long should we keep time shifts for? Because when I was over here. 
SPEAKER 1 0:48:47
Seven years. 
SPEAKER 2 0:48:48
Seven years. 
SPEAKER 1 0:48:49
Can we scan them and keep them on a local drive? 
SPEAKER 2 0:48:53
Or have we got to physically keep them? 
SPEAKER 1 0:48:55
Because when I was over here. Either way. 
SPEAKER 2 0:48:57
Lee says, I'll scan them all over here. They could just kept them on drive. But we've got thousands over there. 
SPEAKER 1 0:49:05
I bet you've got ones over the seven years, though. Well, I found some. He could start with. 
SPEAKER 2 0:49:10
I found some five year old. To that when I was looking for a stapler. I said, John, she went, he said, well, that's why I didn't use it. I said, well, we ain't got to keep it. I said, well, I'll see if we can scan it. 
SPEAKER 1 0:49:21
Let me double check with now. I'm sure. Because it links to payroll. 
SPEAKER 2 0:49:27
If that makes sense. 
SPEAKER 1 0:49:29
Yeah. You have to keep financial information for seven years after audit. Would that not be on all on all that? 
SPEAKER 2 0:49:37
So the time sheets are not all the hours. 
SPEAKER 1 0:49:39
The hours are on that. But the physical piece that the employees filled in. That would be relative to that pay. 
SPEAKER 2 0:49:46
Is there two different things? 
SPEAKER 1 0:49:47
You can hear what I mean. Hawks. 
SPEAKER 2 0:49:49
Hawks. 
SPEAKER 1 0:49:50
What are you thinking about? 
SPEAKER 2 0:49:51
Is your work in progress for a job? 
SPEAKER 1 0:49:53
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:49:54
And the hours because that's why we. It's the hourly pay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:49:57
We have to attach to that payroll. We approve all the hours on. 
SPEAKER 2 0:50:01
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:50:03
Well, yeah, but the time sheets for payroll are approved manually separate. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:50:08
Okay. They're two different points. 
SPEAKER 1 0:50:10
If you let us. If that makes sense. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:50:13
We've got them everywhere. He's got. 
SPEAKER 1 0:50:16
But, you know, as soon as the 2024 is done, you could be getting rid of them from. 
SPEAKER 2 0:50:24
What about what? 
SPEAKER 1 0:50:26
2017. Yeah. I bet you've got way earlier than. Possibly. I mean, I don't know. 
SPEAKER 2 0:50:33
But if we can scan it, we just make three up. 
SPEAKER 1 0:50:38
Well, yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:50:39
Won't be so much of a fire asset to start with. 
SPEAKER 1 0:50:42
Yeah. No, no, I'm sure if we could potentially scan them all. I mean, that's a pretty big job. 
SPEAKER 2 0:50:48
We've got work committed with something we could do. And I can show John how to. Mm hmm. I'll get you later. 
SPEAKER 1 0:50:58
I'll get you back. 
SPEAKER 2 0:51:00
Okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:51:29
Yeah.`
